J	81	AO	Scagel, CF				Scagel, CF			Soil pasteurization and inoculation with Glomus intraradices alters flower production and bulb composition of Zephyranthes spp.	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZATION; INFECTION; NITROGEN; GROWTH; PLANTS; ONION	We assessed whether adding inoculum of the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (VAMF) Glomus intraradices into growing medium of three Zephyranthes spp (White Rain Lily [WRL], Z. candida; Pink Fairy Lily [PFL], Z. robusta; Yellow Zephyr Lily [YZL], Z. sulphurea) alters aspects of flower and bulb production. Shoots of inoculated plants emerged 7-13 d earlier than those of non-inoculated plants. Inoculation slightly delayed the emergence of flower buds on WRL and PFL, but did not delay the time of flower opening of WRL. Inoculated YZL flowered 4-11 d earlier than non-inoculated plants. The number of flowers produced by YZL was consistently increased by inoculation, while the inoculation with VAMF increased flower production by WRL and PFL only when plants were growing in pasteurized soil. Leaf biomass of inoculated WRL was larger than non-inoculated plants, while leaf biomass was generally smaller in inoculated PFL and YZL. Partitioning of biomass to bulbs and offsets varied with species, soil pasteurization, and inoculation. Inoculation increased the combined weight of bulbs and offsets at the end of the second growing cycle by 50-150%. Inoculated YZL and WRL consistently produced more offsets in the second growing season after inoculation. For all species, inoculation increased phosphorus and carbohydrates and decreased nitrogen and amino acids in bulbs. Adding VAMF into the growing medium of Zephyranthes altered aspects of plant development and biomass partitioning important to flower and bulb production during the first growing cycle after inoculation, and most effects of VAMF inoculation are more pronounced in the second growing cycle after inoculation. Of the three species examined, Z. sulphurea showed the most consistent responses to inoculation.

Shoots of inoculated plants emerged 7-13 d earlier than those of non-inoculated plants. Inoculation slightly delayed the emergence of flower buds on WRL and PFL, but did not delay the time of flower opening of WRL. Inoculated YZL flowered 4-11 d earlier than non-inoculated plants. The number of flowers produced by YZL was consistently increased by inoculation, while the inoculation with VAMF increased flower production by WRL and PFL only when plants were growing in pasteurized soil. Leaf biomass of inoculated WRL was larger than non-inoculated plants, while leaf biomass was generally smaller in inoculated PFL and YZL. Partitioning of biomass to bulbs and offsets varied with species, soil pasteurization, and inoculation. Inoculation increased the combined weight of bulbs and offsets at the end of the second growing cycle by 50-150%. Inoculated YZL and WRL consistently produced more offsets in the second growing season after inoculation. For all species, inoculation increased phosphorus and carbohydrates and decreased nitrogen and amino acids in bulbs. Adding VAMF into the growing medium of Zephyranthes altered aspects of plant development and biomass partitioning important to flower and bulb production during the first growing cycle after inoculation, and most effects of VAMF inoculation are more pronounced in the second growing cycle after inoculation.

Shoots of inoculated plants emerged 7-13 d earlier than those of non-inoculated plants. Inoculation slightly delayed the emergence of flower buds on WRL and PFL, but did not delay the time of flower opening of WRL. Inoculated YZL flowered 4-11 d earlier than non-inoculated plants. The number of flowers produced by YZL was consistently increased by inoculation, while the inoculation with VAMF increased flower production by WRL and PFL only when plants were growing in pasteurized soil. Leaf biomass of inoculated WRL was larger than non-inoculated plants, while leaf biomass was generally smaller in inoculated PFL and YZL. Partitioning of biomass to bulbs and offsets varied with species, soil pasteurization, and inoculation. Inoculation increased the combined weight of bulbs and offsets at the end of the second growing cycle by 50-150%. Inoculated YZL and WRL consistently produced more offsets in the second growing season after inoculation. For all species, inoculation increased phosphorus and carbohydrates and decreased nitrogen and amino acids in bulbs. Adding VAMF into the growing medium of Zephyranthes altered aspects of plant development and biomass partitioning important to flower and bulb production during the first growing cycle after inoculation, and most effects of VAMF inoculation are more pronounced in the second growing cycle after inoculation. Of the three species examined, Z. sulphurea showed the most consistent responses to inoculation.

Shoots of inoculated plants emerged 7-13 d earlier than those of non-inoculated plants. Inoculation slightly delayed the emergence of flower buds on WRL and PFL, but did not delay the time of flower opening of WRL. Inoculated YZL flowered 4-11 d earlier than non-inoculated plants. The number of flowers produced by YZL was consistently increased by inoculation, while the inoculation with VAMF increased flower production by WRL and PFL only when plants were growing in pasteurized soil. Leaf biomass of inoculated WRL was larger than non-inoculated plants, while leaf biomass was generally smaller in inoculated PFL and YZL. Partitioning of biomass to bulbs and offsets varied with species, soil pasteurization, and inoculation. Inoculation increased the combined weight of bulbs and offsets at the end of the second growing cycle by 50-150%. Inoculated YZL and WRL consistently produced more offsets in the second growing season after inoculation. For all species, inoculation increased phosphorus and carbohydrates and decreased nitrogen and amino acids in bulbs. Adding VAMF into the growing medium of Zephyranthes altered aspects of plant development and biomass partitioning important to flower and bulb production during the first growing cycle after inoculation, and most effects of VAMF inoculation are more pronounced in the second growing cycle after inoculation. Of the three species examined, Z. sulphurea showed the most consistent responses to inoculation.

Shoots of inoculated plants emerged 7-13 d earlier than those of non-inoculated plants. Inoculation slightly delayed the emergence of flower buds on WRL and PFL, but did not delay the time of flower opening of WRL. Inoculated YZL flowered 4-11 d earlier than non-inoculated plants. The number of flowers produced by YZL was consistently increased by inoculation, while the inoculation with VAMF increased flower production by WRL and PFL only when plants were growing in pasteurized soil. Leaf biomass of inoculated WRL was larger than non-inoculated plants, while leaf biomass was generally smaller in inoculated PFL and YZL. Partitioning of biomass to bulbs and offsets varied with species, soil pasteurization, and inoculation. Inoculation increased the combined weight of bulbs and offsets at the end of the second growing cycle by 50-150%. Inoculated YZL and WRL consistently produced more offsets in the second growing season after inoculation. For all species, inoculation increased phosphorus and carbohydrates and decreased nitrogen and amino acids in bulbs. Adding VAMF into the growing medium of Zephyranthes altered aspects of plant development and biomass partitioning important to flower and bulb production during the first growing cycle after inoculation, and most effects of VAMF inoculation are more pronounced in the second growing cycle after inoculation. Of the three species examined, Z. sulphurea showed the most consistent responses to inoculation.

Shoots of inoculated plants emerged 7-13 d earlier than those of non-inoculated plants. Inoculation slightly delayed the emergence of flower buds on WRL and PFL, but did not delay the time of flower opening of WRL. Inoculated YZL flowered 4-11 d earlier than non-inoculated plants. The number of flowers produced by YZL was consistently increased by inoculation, while the inoculation with VAMF increased flower production by WRL and PFL only when plants were growing in pasteurized soil. Leaf biomass of inoculated WRL was larger than non-inoculated plants, while leaf biomass was generally smaller in inoculated PFL and YZL. Partitioning of biomass to bulbs and offsets varied with species, soil pasteurization, and inoculation. Inoculation increased the combined weight of bulbs and offsets at the end of the second growing cycle by 50-150%. Inoculated YZL and WRL consistently produced more offsets in the second growing season after inoculation. For all species, inoculation increased phosphorus and carbohydrates and decreased nitrogen and amino acids in bulbs. Adding VAMF into the growing medium of Zephyranthes altered aspects of plant development and biomass partitioning important to flower and bulb production during the first growing cycle after inoculation, and most effects of VAMF inoculation are more pronounced in the second growing cycle after inoculation. Of the three species examined, Z. sulphurea showed the most consistent responses to inoculation.

Significant increase in plant height and leaf area index, nodules/plant, number of branches/plant, number of pods/plant and green pod yield was noted when inoculated with Rhizobium phaseoli. Inoculation significantly decreased days to 50% flowering. Residual effect of inoculation on onion (Allium cepa L.) bulb yield was also significant. Fertilizer level of NPK @ 75.0, 64.5, 62.3 kg/ha also increased french bean yield significantly. Residual effect of fertilizer levels showed that onion bulb yield increased significantly with increase in NPK level up to 75.0:64.5:62.3 kg/ha Cultivar 'Lakshmi' was the highest yielder at NPK level of 75.0, 64.5, 62.3 kg/ha in presence of Rhizobium inoculation.

ICPh phytoplasma infection of different A. thaliana ecotypes resulted in a wide range of symptom patterns. Ecotype Col-0 was selected for the repeatable time course and the severity of flower developmental alterations. By inoculating Col-0 at 30 days after germination with ICPh phytoplasma in short day, flowers were produced with increasingly severe symptoms, from carpels modification to virescence, phyllody, loss of determinacy and loss of organ developmental pattern. Gene expression analysis showed strong down regulation of some homeotic genes involved in flowering and genes involved in the gibberellin metabolism. Common morphological features were detected in phyto-plasma-infected wild type plants and healthy mutants impaired in the gene functions that were found to be down-regulated in the infected plants. Evidence from the analysis of morphological alterations and from the results of quantitative real time PCR pointed to a central role of the deregulation of SEPALLATA genes, that are involved in flower development and hormonal control.

To examine the potential importance of phyllosphere microbes on non-disease related plant traits, we used sterile Arabidopsis clones to test the effects of foliar fungi on flowering phenology and reproductive allocation under conditions of varying water stress. We inoculated the sterile plants with fully-factorial combinations of four fungal isolates, then measured flowering time and reproductive allocation for each treatment group under normal and water-stressed conditions. All plants inoculated with foliar fungi had significantly later flowering and greater seed mass than the sterile control groups. The magnitude of this effect depended on the specific fungi present, but individual fungal effects diminished as inoculum richness increased.

Elsholtzia splendens is an indicator species for the presence of copper (Cu) mines because both its flowering phenology and reproduction are tolerant to heavy metals. To test whether effects of Cu on the flowering phenology and reproduction of E. splendens depend on the presence of AMF, we conducted a factorial experiment with two Cu treatments (with or without Cu addition) crossed with two AMF treatments (with or without AMF inoculation). Without AMF, Cu addition significantly delayed the onset dates, ending dates and peak dates of flowering and decreased flowering duration. However, AMF inoculation reversed the effects of Cu stress, with recovered flowering onset and ending dates and increased the flowering duration. Cu addition significantly decreased inflorescence width and number, inflorescence biomass, vegetative biomass and total seed number, but significantly increased 1000-seed weight. AMF inoculation significantly increased vegetative biomass. Two-way ANOVA results showed that the interactive effects between Cu addition and AMF inoculation were significant on the inflorescence number, vegetative biomass and total seed number. These results indicate that AMF can alleviate the Cu stress on the flowering phenology and reproduction of E. splendens.

Elsholtzia splendens is an indicator species for the presence of copper (Cu) mines because both its flowering phenology and reproduction are tolerant to heavy metals. To test whether effects of Cu on the flowering phenology and reproduction of E. splendens depend on the presence of AMF, we conducted a factorial experiment with two Cu treatments (with or without Cu addition) crossed with two AMF treatments (with or without AMF inoculation). Without AMF, Cu addition significantly delayed the onset dates, ending dates and peak dates of flowering and decreased flowering duration. However, AMF inoculation reversed the effects of Cu stress, with recovered flowering onset and ending dates and increased the flowering duration. Cu addition significantly decreased inflorescence width and number, inflorescence biomass, vegetative biomass and total seed number, but significantly increased 1000-seed weight. AMF inoculation significantly increased vegetative biomass. Two-way ANOVA results showed that the interactive effects between Cu addition and AMF inoculation were significant on the inflorescence number, vegetative biomass and total seed number. These results indicate that AMF can alleviate the Cu stress on the flowering phenology and reproduction of E. splendens.

The seed originated from the three populations that represent the overall ecological and productive conditions of Serbian spruce populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two natural populations were selected: Veliki Stolac and Gostilj, and one planted forest population in Srebrenica. The cones were collected in late autumn 2009 and early spring 2010. They were collected from five trees from Srebrenica and Gostilj, and seven trees from Veliki Stolac. Immediately after they were collected, the cones and seeds were processed and germination tests were done. Germination, germination viability and germination dynamics were studied in three categories of seed treatment: 1) control unit (just processed seed), 2) seed stored for six months at 0-4 degrees C, 3) seed stored for seven months at 0-4 degrees C and treated with fungicide after five months of storing. The number of germinated seed was observed and noted on the third, fourth, fifth, seventh, tenth, fourteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eighth day. There were significant differences in germination dynamics at the population level and the level of treatment during the first couple of days of germination test. Fungicide (captan) acted as an inhibitor on seed germination process. The seeds originating from the largest population of Veliki Stolac showed the best response to storing treatment with fungicide related to germination dynamics. The seed originating from Srebrenica andkept at low temperatures 0-4 degrees C without treatment with fungicides showed the best result in germination. Regardless of the presence of differences in the dynamics of germination, significant differences in germination regarding different treatments on the last day of the test, were not recorded.

Four different maternal sibships of Silene latifolia showed no difference in susceptibility to disease by the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum after inoculation of an infectious mixture containing haploid sporidia of both mating types into the growing rosette. Three different combinations of sporidia were used. Two selfing combinations, one using fungus collected from the same population as the host plants, one from a second population, and one cross between strains from the two populations were generated. The three sporidia combinations did not differ in their success in infecting the host plant and sporulating in the flowers. However, this fungal disease altered host plant phenotype in several important ways. Disease retarded flowering in those male plants that initiated flowering in their first season, and it increased the number of flowers produced by both male and female plants. Different fungal strains differentially augmented Bower production, indicating that there is genetic variability for important fitness-related life-history traits in natural populations of the fungus M. violaceum in Europe. Furthermore, in this short-lived perennial host plant, diseased plants were more likely than were healthy ones to initiate flowering in their first growing season. Since this shift from vegetative growth to reproduction should enhance fungal reproductive success, we interpret this as a manipulation of the host plant phenotype by the fungus. In addition we found a significantly female-biased sex ratio across the four maternal sibships in this study and higher infection rates for female plants than males.

Four different maternal sibships of Silene latifolia showed no difference in susceptibility to disease by the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum after inoculation of an infectious mixture containing haploid sporidia of both mating types into the growing rosette. Three different combinations of sporidia were used. Two selfing combinations, one using fungus collected from the same population as the host plants, one from a second population, and one cross between strains from the two populations were generated. The three sporidia combinations did not differ in their success in infecting the host plant and sporulating in the flowers. However, this fungal disease altered host plant phenotype in several important ways. Disease retarded flowering in those male plants that initiated flowering in their first season, and it increased the number of flowers produced by both male and female plants. Different fungal strains differentially augmented Bower production, indicating that there is genetic variability for important fitness-related life-history traits in natural populations of the fungus M. violaceum in Europe. Furthermore, in this short-lived perennial host plant, diseased plants were more likely than were healthy ones to initiate flowering in their first growing season. Since this shift from vegetative growth to reproduction should enhance fungal reproductive success, we interpret this as a manipulation of the host plant phenotype by the fungus. In addition we found a significantly female-biased sex ratio across the four maternal sibships in this study and higher infection rates for female plants than males.

In order to understand the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on growth of ephemerals, a pot experiment was conducted in greenhouse conditions. Two desert ephemerals, Erodium oxyrrhynchum and Plantago minuta, were tested for their response to inoculation with two AM fungi, BEG 167 (Glomus mosseae) and BEG 141 (Glomus intraradices). The results showed that mycorrhizal colonization led to marked improvement in both the reproductive (timing of flowering and number of seeds) and vegetative (dry matter) phase of the two ephemeral plants. Dry weight per plant inoculated with AM fungi was 57 to 67 percent higher than the control in E. oxyrrhynchum and 8 to 11 times higher than the control in P. minuta. Anthesis was advanced by 14 to 17d in P. minuta and 5 to 7d in E. oxyrrhynchum, respectively, when both plants were inoculated with AM fungi. Colonization of mycorrhizal fungi significantly increased the total number of seeds or fruits per plant. Water use efficiency and photosynthetic rates were significantly higher in inoculated E. oxyrrhynchum plants than those of non-inoculated plants. These results indicate that although the two spring ephemerals were able to finish their life cycle without AM fungi, the fungi might greatly enhance survival and population expansion by advancing the timing of flowering and by increasing seed production in the desert environment in the spring.

Colonization of mycorrhizal fungi significantly increased the total number of seeds or fruits per plant. Water use efficiency and photosynthetic rates were significantly higher in inoculated E. oxyrrhynchum plants than those of non-inoculated plants. These results indicate that although the two spring ephemerals were able to finish their life cycle without AM fungi, the fungi might greatly enhance survival and population expansion by advancing the timing of flowering and by increasing seed production in the desert environment in the spring.

Evidence shows enhanced fitness of endophyte infected grasses relative to non-infected ones. Some studies of seed germination show endophyte enhancement of plant fitness in various environments, but inconsistent results indicate that further studies are needed. So far, experiments have failed to separate the confounded effects of population origin and seed management. For this reason, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed dormancy and germination in Lolium multiflorum using an experimental design controlling these factors. Depending on the year of seed production, endophyte infection modified seed response to light quality, affecting predominantly seed dormancy levels. Nevertheless, the endophyte did not affect base temperature or thermal time of germination. We concluded that endophytes were not a strong influence on germination behaviour. We speculate from our results that the presence of the endophyte changes germination by an indirect effect, in extending growth of the maternal plant during seed development and ripening. The direct effect of hyphae in the seed on seed behaviour was disregarded, because the difference between infected and non-infected seed varied within the year of seed production. Future experiments should focus on effects of the endophyte on the canopy of parent plants during seed production and ripening, and, hence, on subsequent dormancy and germination of the seeds.

Evidence shows enhanced fitness of endophyte infected grasses relative to non-infected ones. Some studies of seed germination show endophyte enhancement of plant fitness in various environments, but inconsistent results indicate that further studies are needed. So far, experiments have failed to separate the confounded effects of population origin and seed management. For this reason, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed dormancy and germination in Lolium multiflorum using an experimental design controlling these factors. Depending on the year of seed production, endophyte infection modified seed response to light quality, affecting predominantly seed dormancy levels. Nevertheless, the endophyte did not affect base temperature or thermal time of germination. We concluded that endophytes were not a strong influence on germination behaviour. We speculate from our results that the presence of the endophyte changes germination by an indirect effect, in extending growth of the maternal plant during seed development and ripening. The direct effect of hyphae in the seed on seed behaviour was disregarded, because the difference between infected and non-infected seed varied within the year of seed production.

Evidence shows enhanced fitness of endophyte infected grasses relative to non-infected ones. Some studies of seed germination show endophyte enhancement of plant fitness in various environments, but inconsistent results indicate that further studies are needed. So far, experiments have failed to separate the confounded effects of population origin and seed management. For this reason, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed dormancy and germination in Lolium multiflorum using an experimental design controlling these factors. Depending on the year of seed production, endophyte infection modified seed response to light quality, affecting predominantly seed dormancy levels. Nevertheless, the endophyte did not affect base temperature or thermal time of germination. We concluded that endophytes were not a strong influence on germination behaviour. We speculate from our results that the presence of the endophyte changes germination by an indirect effect, in extending growth of the maternal plant during seed development and ripening. The direct effect of hyphae in the seed on seed behaviour was disregarded, because the difference between infected and non-infected seed varied within the year of seed production.

Evidence shows enhanced fitness of endophyte infected grasses relative to non-infected ones. Some studies of seed germination show endophyte enhancement of plant fitness in various environments, but inconsistent results indicate that further studies are needed. So far, experiments have failed to separate the confounded effects of population origin and seed management. For this reason, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed dormancy and germination in Lolium multiflorum using an experimental design controlling these factors. Depending on the year of seed production, endophyte infection modified seed response to light quality, affecting predominantly seed dormancy levels. Nevertheless, the endophyte did not affect base temperature or thermal time of germination. We concluded that endophytes were not a strong influence on germination behaviour. We speculate from our results that the presence of the endophyte changes germination by an indirect effect, in extending growth of the maternal plant during seed development and ripening.

Evidence shows enhanced fitness of endophyte infected grasses relative to non-infected ones. Some studies of seed germination show endophyte enhancement of plant fitness in various environments, but inconsistent results indicate that further studies are needed. So far, experiments have failed to separate the confounded effects of population origin and seed management. For this reason, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed dormancy and germination in Lolium multiflorum using an experimental design controlling these factors. Depending on the year of seed production, endophyte infection modified seed response to light quality, affecting predominantly seed dormancy levels. Nevertheless, the endophyte did not affect base temperature or thermal time of germination. We concluded that endophytes were not a strong influence on germination behaviour. We speculate from our results that the presence of the endophyte changes germination by an indirect effect, in extending growth of the maternal plant during seed development and ripening. The direct effect of hyphae in the seed on seed behaviour was disregarded, because the difference between infected and non-infected seed varied within the year of seed production. Future experiments should focus on effects of the endophyte on the canopy of parent plants during seed production and ripening, and, hence, on subsequent dormancy and germination of the seeds.

Effects of the Neotyphodium endophyte fungus on dormancy and germination rate of Lolium multiflorum seeds	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						dormancy; germination rate; Lolium multiflorum; maternal effect; Neotyphodium	HYDROTHERMAL TIME; GROWTH; PSEUDOREPLICATION; TEMPERATURE; POPULATIONS; GRASSES	Neotyphodium frequently occurs as an endophyte in grasses. Evidence shows enhanced fitness of endophyte infected grasses relative to non-infected ones. Some studies of seed germination show endophyte enhancement of plant fitness in various environments, but inconsistent results indicate that further studies are needed. So far, experiments have failed to separate the confounded effects of population origin and seed management. For this reason, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed dormancy and germination in Lolium multiflorum using an experimental design controlling these factors. Depending on the year of seed production, endophyte infection modified seed response to light quality, affecting predominantly seed dormancy levels. Nevertheless, the endophyte did not affect base temperature or thermal time of germination. We concluded that endophytes were not a strong influence on germination behaviour. We speculate from our results that the presence of the endophyte changes germination by an indirect effect, in extending growth of the maternal plant during seed development and ripening. The direct effect of hyphae in the seed on seed behaviour was disregarded, because the difference between infected and non-infected seed varied within the year of seed production. Future experiments should focus on effects of the endophyte on the canopy of parent plants during seed production and ripening, and, hence, on subsequent dormancy and germination of the seeds.

Tubers and flowers of calla responded differently to AMF inoculation. Differences in mycorrhizal responsiveness between cultivars was related to differences in P requirements for flower and tuber production, and the influence of P supply on resource allocation to different reproductive strategies. Inoculation increased shoot production and promoted early flowering, particularly in 2003. Inoculated plants also produced larger tubers than non-inoculated plants, but only increased the number of flowers per plant in 2003. High P supply also increased tuber biomass, but decreased the number of flowers per plant in 2002. Plants grown at a moderate P-rate, produced the most flowers in 2003. For 'Majestic Red', benefits from AMF were primarily in terms of tuber yield and composition, and AMF effects on marketable flower production could potentially have negative impact on production strategies for growers. Inoculation of 'Pot of Gold' primarily influenced flower production and aspects of tuber quality that caused detectable enhancement of tuber yield and flowering in the second growing cycle following inoculation (2003). The results of this study show that the responses of calla to AMF are partially a function of how nutrient supply alters resource allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction. Whether AMF-induced changes in resource allocation to flowering and tubers significantly alters commercial productivity and quality of calla depends on the crop production goals (e.g. tubers, cut flowers or potted plants).

Tubers and flowers of calla responded differently to AMF inoculation. Differences in mycorrhizal responsiveness between cultivars was related to differences in P requirements for flower and tuber production, and the influence of P supply on resource allocation to different reproductive strategies. Inoculation increased shoot production and promoted early flowering, particularly in 2003. Inoculated plants also produced larger tubers than non-inoculated plants, but only increased the number of flowers per plant in 2003. High P supply also increased tuber biomass, but decreased the number of flowers per plant in 2002. Plants grown at a moderate P-rate, produced the most flowers in 2003. For 'Majestic Red', benefits from AMF were primarily in terms of tuber yield and composition, and AMF effects on marketable flower production could potentially have negative impact on production strategies for growers. Inoculation of 'Pot of Gold' primarily influenced flower production and aspects of tuber quality that caused detectable enhancement of tuber yield and flowering in the second growing cycle following inoculation (2003). The results of this study show that the responses of calla to AMF are partially a function of how nutrient supply alters resource allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction. Whether AMF-induced changes in resource allocation to flowering and tubers significantly alters commercial productivity and quality of calla depends on the crop production goals (e.g. tubers, cut flowers or potted plants).

Tubers and flowers of calla responded differently to AMF inoculation. Differences in mycorrhizal responsiveness between cultivars was related to differences in P requirements for flower and tuber production, and the influence of P supply on resource allocation to different reproductive strategies. Inoculation increased shoot production and promoted early flowering, particularly in 2003. Inoculated plants also produced larger tubers than non-inoculated plants, but only increased the number of flowers per plant in 2003. High P supply also increased tuber biomass, but decreased the number of flowers per plant in 2002. Plants grown at a moderate P-rate, produced the most flowers in 2003. For 'Majestic Red', benefits from AMF were primarily in terms of tuber yield and composition, and AMF effects on marketable flower production could potentially have negative impact on production strategies for growers. Inoculation of 'Pot of Gold' primarily influenced flower production and aspects of tuber quality that caused detectable enhancement of tuber yield and flowering in the second growing cycle following inoculation (2003). The results of this study show that the responses of calla to AMF are partially a function of how nutrient supply alters resource allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction.

Inoculated plants also produced larger tubers than non-inoculated plants, but only increased the number of flowers per plant in 2003. High P supply also increased tuber biomass, but decreased the number of flowers per plant in 2002. Plants grown at a moderate P-rate, produced the most flowers in 2003. For 'Majestic Red', benefits from AMF were primarily in terms of tuber yield and composition, and AMF effects on marketable flower production could potentially have negative impact on production strategies for growers. Inoculation of 'Pot of Gold' primarily influenced flower production and aspects of tuber quality that caused detectable enhancement of tuber yield and flowering in the second growing cycle following inoculation (2003). The results of this study show that the responses of calla to AMF are partially a function of how nutrient supply alters resource allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction. Whether AMF-induced changes in resource allocation to flowering and tubers significantly alters commercial productivity and quality of calla depends on the crop production goals (e.g. tubers, cut flowers or potted plants).

High P supply also increased tuber biomass, but decreased the number of flowers per plant in 2002. Plants grown at a moderate P-rate, produced the most flowers in 2003. For 'Majestic Red', benefits from AMF were primarily in terms of tuber yield and composition, and AMF effects on marketable flower production could potentially have negative impact on production strategies for growers. Inoculation of 'Pot of Gold' primarily influenced flower production and aspects of tuber quality that caused detectable enhancement of tuber yield and flowering in the second growing cycle following inoculation (2003). The results of this study show that the responses of calla to AMF are partially a function of how nutrient supply alters resource allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction. Whether AMF-induced changes in resource allocation to flowering and tubers significantly alters commercial productivity and quality of calla depends on the crop production goals (e.g. tubers, cut flowers or potted plants).

First generation (maternal) plants were grown either with or without mycorrhizal inoculation with Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith. We collected early and late cohorts of seeds which were used to produce second generation (offspring) plants. Offspring plants were grown either with or without mycorrhizal inoculation with G. intraradices. Irrespective of maternal mycorrhizal status, we found that offspring of early cohort seeds had greater percent mycorrhizal colonization early in the growing season, a greater proportion of plants flowering early in the season, and a greater number of capsules per plant at the end of the season compared with offspring of late cohort seeds. These differences were observed despite the fact that shoot N and P concentrations were greater in offspring of late cohort seeds. We found that mycorrhizal colonization of maternal plants decreased the average time to reproductive maturity in offspring plants, but did not significantly influence any other vegetative or reproductive trait in the offspring plants. Mycorrhizal colonization of offspring plants resulted in a greater number of branches per plant and a greater number of mature capsules per branch. Mycorrhizal colonization of offspring plants also resulted in a significant increase in seed P content, but only for seeds that were produced late in the growing season. We conclude that mycorrhizal colonization of the offspring generation was more important than mycorrhizal colonization of the maternal generation in determining offspring reproductive output, but maternal seed cohort is an important interacting factor that influences offspring fecundity.

Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN induces long-term metabolic and transcriptional changes involved in Arabidopsis thaliana salt tolerance	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR); ion transport; osmotic stress response; priming; abiotic stress tolerance; reactive oxygen species (ROS); rhizosphere; beneficial bacteria	GROWTH-PROMOTING RHIZOBACTERIUM; ABIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCE; VITIS-VINIFERA L.; PLANT-GROWTH; OXIDATIVE STRESS; NA+ TRANSPORT; ACC DEAMINASE; SALINITY; GENE; EXPRESSION	Salinity is one of the major limitations for food production worldwide. Improvement of plant salt-stress tolerance using plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has arisen as a promising strategy to help overcome this limitation. However, the molecular and biochemical mechanisms controlling PGPR/plant interactions under salt-stress remain unclear. The main objective of this study was to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying salt-stress tolerance enhancement in the salt-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants, when inoculated with the well-known PGPR strain Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN. To tackle this, different life history traits, together with the spatiotemporal accumulation patterns for key metabolites and salt-stress related transcripts, were analyzed in inoculated plants under short and long-term salt-stress. Inoculated plants displayed faster recovery and increased tolerance after sustained salt-stress. PsJN treatment accelerated the accumulation of proline and transcription of genes related to abscisic acid signaling (Relative to Dessication, RD29A and RD29B), ROS scavenging Oscorbate Peroxidase 2), and detoxification (Glyoxalase I 7), and down-regulated the expression of Lipoxygenase 2 (related to jasmonic acid biosynthesis). Among the general transcriptional effects of this bacterium, the expression pattern of important ion-homeostasis related genes was altered after short and longterm stress (Arabidopsis K Transporter 1, High-Affinity K Transporter 1, Sodium Hydrogen Exchanger 2, and Arabidopsis Salt Overly Sensitive 1). In all, the faster and stronger molecular changes induced by the inoculation suggest a PsJN-priming effect, which may explain the observed tolerance after short-term and sustained salt-stress in plants. This study provides novel information about possible mechanisms involved in salt-stress tolerance induced by PGPR in plants, showing that certain changes are maintained over time. This opens up new venues to study these relevant biological associations, as well as new approaches to a better understanding of the spatiotemporal mechanisms involved in stress tolerance in plants.

Flowering and stem densities of the cool-season grass, Dichanthelium oligosanthes, sedges (Carex spp.), and the forb Aster ericoides were higher in non-mycorrhizal (benomyl-treated) than in mycorrrhizal plots and the magnitude of these differences was significantly affected by burning. Mycorrhizae significantly enhanced flowering of the warm-season grasses Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans in burned prairie, but not in unburned sites. These patterns suggest that mycorrhizal effects on the dynamics of cool-season graminoid and forb populations are likely to be mediated indirectly through effects of the symbiosis on the competitive dominance of their neighbors. Seedling emergence rates of the cool-season C-3 grasses Elymus canadensis and Koeleria cristata were significantly reduced in the benomyl-treated plots, whereas benomyl treatment had no significant effect on seedling emergence of the warm-season C-4 grasses A. gerardii and Panicum virgatum. The forbs showed variable responses. Seedling emergence of Liatris aspera was greater under mycorrhizal conditions, but that of Dalea purpurea was unaffected by mycorrhizal treatment. These results show that effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis on the population dynamics of co-occurring prairie plants vary significantly both among species and among different life history stages within species. The results also indicate that mycorrhizas and fire interact to influence competitive interactions and demographic patterns of tallgrass prairie plant populations.

Flowering and stem densities of the cool-season grass, Dichanthelium oligosanthes, sedges (Carex spp.), and the forb Aster ericoides were higher in non-mycorrhizal (benomyl-treated) than in mycorrrhizal plots and the magnitude of these differences was significantly affected by burning. Mycorrhizae significantly enhanced flowering of the warm-season grasses Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans in burned prairie, but not in unburned sites. These patterns suggest that mycorrhizal effects on the dynamics of cool-season graminoid and forb populations are likely to be mediated indirectly through effects of the symbiosis on the competitive dominance of their neighbors. Seedling emergence rates of the cool-season C-3 grasses Elymus canadensis and Koeleria cristata were significantly reduced in the benomyl-treated plots, whereas benomyl treatment had no significant effect on seedling emergence of the warm-season C-4 grasses A. gerardii and Panicum virgatum. The forbs showed variable responses. Seedling emergence of Liatris aspera was greater under mycorrhizal conditions, but that of Dalea purpurea was unaffected by mycorrhizal treatment. These results show that effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis on the population dynamics of co-occurring prairie plants vary significantly both among species and among different life history stages within species. The results also indicate that mycorrhizas and fire interact to influence competitive interactions and demographic patterns of tallgrass prairie plant populations.

Postemergence damping-off was reduced in loblolly pine when seed was treated with 3 of the 12 bacterial strains; however, postemergence damping-off on slash pine seedlings was not affected by rhizobacteria. Treatment with rhizobacteria had a significant positive and negative effect on seedling growth and biomass, which depended on tree species. Loblolly pine shoot and root lengths, as well as the above-and belowground biomass, were significantly reduced when seeds were treated with strains BS1 and BS2. In contrast, loblolly pine seeds treated with strains BS3, PM2, and INR7 significantly increased the below ground biomass of the seedling root systems. Slash pine seedlings had similar interactions with the bacterial strains. Strain BS1 significantly reduced shoot lengths compared with nontreated seeds, while strains 90-166, INR7, and SE49 increased shoot biomass. Slash pine root lengths and biomass were also reduced when treated with strains BS1 and BS2. Unlike loblolly pine, no bacterial strain increased slash pine root length or biomass. Th is study suggests th at the effects of rhizobacteria inoculation on seeding emergence and plant growth are independent and that the effects are species specific.

All bacterial strains significantly increased the speed of seedling emergence over nontreated pine seed. By 12 wk, however, no differences in stand densities were observed between bacteria-treated and nontreated seed for either pine species. Postemergence damping-off was reduced in loblolly pine when seed was treated with 3 of the 12 bacterial strains; however, postemergence damping-off on slash pine seedlings was not affected by rhizobacteria. Treatment with rhizobacteria had a significant positive and negative effect on seedling growth and biomass, which depended on tree species. Loblolly pine shoot and root lengths, as well as the above-and belowground biomass, were significantly reduced when seeds were treated with strains BS1 and BS2. In contrast, loblolly pine seeds treated with strains BS3, PM2, and INR7 significantly increased the below ground biomass of the seedling root systems. Slash pine seedlings had similar interactions with the bacterial strains. Strain BS1 significantly reduced shoot lengths compared with nontreated seeds, while strains 90-166, INR7, and SE49 increased shoot biomass. Slash pine root lengths and biomass were also reduced when treated with strains BS1 and BS2. Unlike loblolly pine, no bacterial strain increased slash pine root length or biomass. Th is study suggests th at the effects of rhizobacteria inoculation on seeding emergence and plant growth are independent and that the effects are species specific.

All bacterial strains significantly increased the speed of seedling emergence over nontreated pine seed. By 12 wk, however, no differences in stand densities were observed between bacteria-treated and nontreated seed for either pine species. Postemergence damping-off was reduced in loblolly pine when seed was treated with 3 of the 12 bacterial strains; however, postemergence damping-off on slash pine seedlings was not affected by rhizobacteria. Treatment with rhizobacteria had a significant positive and negative effect on seedling growth and biomass, which depended on tree species. Loblolly pine shoot and root lengths, as well as the above-and belowground biomass, were significantly reduced when seeds were treated with strains BS1 and BS2. In contrast, loblolly pine seeds treated with strains BS3, PM2, and INR7 significantly increased the below ground biomass of the seedling root systems. Slash pine seedlings had similar interactions with the bacterial strains. Strain BS1 significantly reduced shoot lengths compared with nontreated seeds, while strains 90-166, INR7, and SE49 increased shoot biomass. Slash pine root lengths and biomass were also reduced when treated with strains BS1 and BS2. Unlike loblolly pine, no bacterial strain increased slash pine root length or biomass. Th is study suggests th at the effects of rhizobacteria inoculation on seeding emergence and plant growth are independent and that the effects are species specific.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of cultivation systems, associated or not with an inoculant, in the precocity of soybean cultivars at the green grain growth stage. The research was led in field conditions, in CCA/UFPB, Areia-PB with an experimental design in randomized blocks, in sub-subdivided plots (3 x 2 x 2), three cultivars (Pati, JLM 004 and Pirarara), with and without inoculation and in systems of single cultivation and intercropped with corn, with four replicates. Cultivar precocity was evaluated through the numbers of days until emergence, flowering, and maturation, the reproductive period and the number of harvested plants. The cultivar JLM 004 features the longest emergence period, but it develops to the other reproductive phases in less time and with lower number of plants at harvest; cultivar Pirarara presents the longest time for the reproductive cycle, the same as cultivar Pati, when intercropped and with inoculation; the intercrop system and the inoculation increase the number of days for the maturation of cultivar Pati, while the monocrop system and without inoculation extends the necessary time for the maturation Of cultivar Pirarara.

The cultivar JLM 004 features the longest emergence period, but it develops to the other reproductive phases in less time and with lower number of plants at harvest; cultivar Pirarara presents the longest time for the reproductive cycle, the same as cultivar Pati, when intercropped and with inoculation; the intercrop system and the inoculation increase the number of days for the maturation of cultivar Pati, while the monocrop system and without inoculation extends the necessary time for the maturation Of cultivar Pirarara.

A mutualistic endophyte alters the niche dimensions of its host plant	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Epichloe; fungal endophyte; mutualism; Poa leptocoma; Poa reflexa; symbiosis	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; PERENNIAL RYEGRASS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; STRESS TOLERANCE; TALL FESCUE; SYMBIOSIS; COMMUNITY; GRASSES; COEXISTENCE	Mutualisms can play important roles in influencing species coexistence and determining community composition. However, few studies have tested whether such interactions can affect species distributions by altering the niches of partner species. In subalpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, USA, we explored whether the presence of a fungal endophyte (genus Epichloe) may shift the niche of its partner plant, marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) relative to a closely related but endophyte-free grass species, nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa). Using observations and a 3-year field experiment, we tested two questions: (i) Do P. leptocoma and P. reflexa occupy different ecological niches? and (ii) Does endophyte presence affect the relative fitness of P. leptocoma versus P. reflexa in the putative niches of these grass species? The two species were less likely to co-occur than expected by chance. Specifically, P. leptocoma grew closer to water sources and in wetter soils than P. reflexa, and also had higher root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma seeds germinated with greater frequency in P. leptocoma niches relative to P. reflexa niches, whereas neither endophyte-free (experimentally removed) P. leptocoma seeds nor P. reflexa seeds showed differential germination between the two niche types. Thus, endophyte presence constrained the germination and early survival of host plants to microsites occupied by P. leptocoma. However, endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma ultimately showed greater growth than endophyte-free plants across all microsites, indicating a net benefit of the symbiosis at this life history stage. Differential effects of endophyte symbiosis on different host life history stages may thus contribute to niche partitioning between the two congeneric plant species. Our study therefore identifies a symbiotic relationship as a potential mechanism facilitating the coexistence of two species, suggesting that symbiont effects on host niche may have community-level consequences.

The mean performance indicated significant superiority of 'Shalimar Masoor V to 'SKL 16' and 'SKL 9' in terms of growth, yield attributes, grain yield (0.81, 0.72 and 0.64 tonnes/ha), N and P uptake and nodulation and also recorded marked reduction in days (5.9 days) to flowering and maturity. Rhizobium inoculation with seed and soil inoculation methods significantly improved the growth, yield attributes, grain yield, straw yield, nodulation and N and P uptake in lentil. Pseudomonas alone either seed inoculated or soil inoculated recorded markedly more number and dry weight of nodules at all the intervals and growth and yield attributes and yield over uninoculated control. Seed inoculation with Pseudomonas markedly enhanced dry matter production (142.6 g/m row), grains/pod (1.69), grain weight/plant (1.45 g), grain yield (0.72 tonnes/ha), straw yield, N and P uptake and nodulation at all the intervals over soil inoculation with Pseudomonas was at par in terms of days to flowering and maturity and pods/plant. Dual inoculation of Rhizobium+Pseudomonas with both the methods recorded significantly higher number and dry weight of nodules, N and P uptake, yield, yield attributes and growth parameters over individual inoculation with Rhizobium and Pseudomonas with respective methods. Dual inoculation of seed with Rhizobium+Pseudomonas markedly gave 21.2 and 48.9% higher grain yield and 28.5 and 55.9% more straw yield over the dual inoculation of soil with Rhizobium+Pseudomonas and uninoculated control respectively. Seed inoculation method gave more occupancy in nodules than soil inoculation with all the treatments. Dual inoculation of Rhizobium+Pseudomonas recorded markedly higher nodule occupancy than Rhizobium alone at different root portions with both seed and soil inoculation methods.	[Singh, U.; Saad, A.

Two endophytic strains were selected as inocula for the pot experiment: Pseudomonas sp. ISE-12 (B1) and Xanthomonadales sp. CSE-34 (B2). Surface-sterilised seeds were incubated in the bacterial inoculation suspensions before sowing and cultivated in a sterile mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1). Six salinity treatments were taken into account: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300mM NaCl. Inoculation of seeds with B1 and B2 positively affected germination percentage and germination index and shortened mean germination time, which led to a quickening of the growth stages of seedlings. After 42days inoculated plants had, in general, a greater root length, higher dry biomass, lower tissue water content and lower specific leaf area compared with the control. While the positive effect of B2 bacteria was visible only at low salinity, strain B1 stimulated plant growth at higher salinities (200 and 300mM NaCl). We suggest that the superior growth promotion observed for B1 may be related to the higher metabolic activity of these bacteria.

Two endophytic strains were selected as inocula for the pot experiment: Pseudomonas sp. ISE-12 (B1) and Xanthomonadales sp. CSE-34 (B2). Surface-sterilised seeds were incubated in the bacterial inoculation suspensions before sowing and cultivated in a sterile mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1). Six salinity treatments were taken into account: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300mM NaCl. Inoculation of seeds with B1 and B2 positively affected germination percentage and germination index and shortened mean germination time, which led to a quickening of the growth stages of seedlings. After 42days inoculated plants had, in general, a greater root length, higher dry biomass, lower tissue water content and lower specific leaf area compared with the control. While the positive effect of B2 bacteria was visible only at low salinity, strain B1 stimulated plant growth at higher salinities (200 and 300mM NaCl).

Two endophytic strains were selected as inocula for the pot experiment: Pseudomonas sp. ISE-12 (B1) and Xanthomonadales sp. CSE-34 (B2). Surface-sterilised seeds were incubated in the bacterial inoculation suspensions before sowing and cultivated in a sterile mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1). Six salinity treatments were taken into account: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300mM NaCl. Inoculation of seeds with B1 and B2 positively affected germination percentage and germination index and shortened mean germination time, which led to a quickening of the growth stages of seedlings. After 42days inoculated plants had, in general, a greater root length, higher dry biomass, lower tissue water content and lower specific leaf area compared with the control. While the positive effect of B2 bacteria was visible only at low salinity, strain B1 stimulated plant growth at higher salinities (200 and 300mM NaCl). We suggest that the superior growth promotion observed for B1 may be related to the higher metabolic activity of these bacteria.

Two endophytic strains were selected as inocula for the pot experiment: Pseudomonas sp. ISE-12 (B1) and Xanthomonadales sp. CSE-34 (B2). Surface-sterilised seeds were incubated in the bacterial inoculation suspensions before sowing and cultivated in a sterile mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1). Six salinity treatments were taken into account: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300mM NaCl. Inoculation of seeds with B1 and B2 positively affected germination percentage and germination index and shortened mean germination time, which led to a quickening of the growth stages of seedlings. After 42days inoculated plants had, in general, a greater root length, higher dry biomass, lower tissue water content and lower specific leaf area compared with the control. While the positive effect of B2 bacteria was visible only at low salinity, strain B1 stimulated plant growth at higher salinities (200 and 300mM NaCl).

Screening for efficient AM (arbuscular mycorrhizal) fungal bioinoculants for two commercially important ornamental flowering plant species of Asteraceae	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE			English	Article						AM fungi; Chrysanthemum morifolium; flower quality; ornamental flowers; Tagetes erecta	GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; INOCULATION; GROWTH; COLONIZATION; GENOTYPES	The objective of this study was to screen for the most efficient arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal bioinoculant and to evaluate possible effects of inoculation of different species of AM fungi on growth, yield, and flower fresh weight loss in two ornamental plant species of commercial importance, Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. and Tagetes erecta L. The research work was carried out in 2010-2011. The treatments included uninoculated control and plants inoculated with pure cultures of AM species (Acaulospora laevis, A. scrobiculata, Glomus coremioides, G. intraradices G. fasciculatum, G. mannihotis and Gigaspora albida). A complete randomized block design in factorial arrangement with five replicates was employed. Root and shoot length and dry weight, number of lateral branches, number of days required for flowering, and number, diameter, fresh weight of flower and fresh weight loss of flower/day were recorded. Results showed that inoculation of AM species had a significant effect on plant growth and flower quantity and quality. Increased flower number in C. morifolium (11-22%) and T. erecta (13-66%) was observed upon AM inoculation compared with the uninoculated control. Glomus intraradices proved to be the most efficient AM fungal bioinoculant, increasing flower number in both the plant species. This is attributed to its ability to colonize and multiply at a faster rate than the other AM fungal species used in the study.	[Vaingankar, J. D.; Rodrigues, B.

Screening for efficient AM (arbuscular mycorrhizal) fungal bioinoculants for two commercially important ornamental flowering plant species of Asteraceae	BIOLOGICAL AGRICULTURE & HORTICULTURE			English	Article						AM fungi; Chrysanthemum morifolium; flower quality; ornamental flowers; Tagetes erecta	GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; INOCULATION; GROWTH; COLONIZATION; GENOTYPES	The objective of this study was to screen for the most efficient arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal bioinoculant and to evaluate possible effects of inoculation of different species of AM fungi on growth, yield, and flower fresh weight loss in two ornamental plant species of commercial importance, Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. and Tagetes erecta L. The research work was carried out in 2010-2011. The treatments included uninoculated control and plants inoculated with pure cultures of AM species (Acaulospora laevis, A. scrobiculata, Glomus coremioides, G. intraradices G. fasciculatum, G. mannihotis and Gigaspora albida). A complete randomized block design in factorial arrangement with five replicates was employed. Root and shoot length and dry weight, number of lateral branches, number of days required for flowering, and number, diameter, fresh weight of flower and fresh weight loss of flower/day were recorded. Results showed that inoculation of AM species had a significant effect on plant growth and flower quantity and quality. Increased flower number in C. morifolium (11-22%) and T. erecta (13-66%) was observed upon AM inoculation compared with the uninoculated control. Glomus intraradices proved to be the most efficient AM fungal bioinoculant, increasing flower number in both the plant species. This is attributed to its ability to colonize and multiply at a faster rate than the other AM fungal species used in the study.	[Vaingankar, J. D.; Rodrigues, B.

Here, we report a high level of reproducibility of soil microbiomes in altering plant flowering time and soil functions when partnered within and between plant hosts. We used a multi-generation experimental system using Arabidopsis thaliana Col to select for soil microbiomes inducing earlier or later flowering times of their hosts. We then inoculated the selected microbiomes from the tenth generation of plantings into the soils of three additional A. thaliana genotypes (Ler, Be, RLD) and a related crucifer (Brassica rapa). With the exception of Ler, all other plant hosts showed a shift in flowering time corresponding with the inoculation of early- or late-flowering microbiomes. Analysis of the soil microbial community using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing showed distinct microbiota profiles assembling by flowering time treatment. Plant hosts grown with the late-flowering-associated microbiomes showed consequent increases in inflorescence biomass for three A. thaliana genotypes and an increase in total biomass for B. rapa. The increase in biomass was correlated with two-to five-fold enhancement of microbial extracellular enzyme activities associated with nitrogen mineralization in soils. The reproducibility of the flowering phenotype across plant hosts suggests that microbiomes can be selected to modify plant traits and coordinate changes in soil resource pools.

Plant emergence was followed, together with bacterial rhizosphere colonization, antibiotic production and effects on fungal growth. P. fluorescens DR54 inoculation of the P. ultimum-challenged seeds improved plant emergence after 7 days compared to a control without the biocontrol strain. At this time, P. fluorescens DR54 was the dominating colony-forming pseudomonad in rhizosphere soil samples from inoculated seedlings as shown by immune-staining with a strain specific antibody. Viscosinamide, a cyclic lipopeptide, which has previously been identified as a major antagonistic determinant produced by P. fluorescens DR54 and shown to induce physiological changes in P. ultimum in vitro, could be detected in the rhizosphere samples. The impact of P. fluorescens DR54 on the growth and activity of P. ultimum was studied by direct microscopy after staining with the vital fluorescent dyes Calcofluor white and fluorescein diacetate. P. fluorescens DR54 caused reduction in P. ultimum mycelial density, oospore formation and intracellular activity. Further, Pythium oospore formation was absent in the presence of P. fluorescens DR54. A striking effect on zoospore forming indigenous Fungi was also observed in microcosms with P. fluorescens DR54 and, thus, where viscosinamide could be detected; a large number of encysted zoospores were seen in such microcosms both with and without P. ultimum infections.

Plant emergence was followed, together with bacterial rhizosphere colonization, antibiotic production and effects on fungal growth. P. fluorescens DR54 inoculation of the P. ultimum-challenged seeds improved plant emergence after 7 days compared to a control without the biocontrol strain. At this time, P. fluorescens DR54 was the dominating colony-forming pseudomonad in rhizosphere soil samples from inoculated seedlings as shown by immune-staining with a strain specific antibody. Viscosinamide, a cyclic lipopeptide, which has previously been identified as a major antagonistic determinant produced by P. fluorescens DR54 and shown to induce physiological changes in P. ultimum in vitro, could be detected in the rhizosphere samples. The impact of P. fluorescens DR54 on the growth and activity of P. ultimum was studied by direct microscopy after staining with the vital fluorescent dyes Calcofluor white and fluorescein diacetate. P. fluorescens DR54 caused reduction in P. ultimum mycelial density, oospore formation and intracellular activity. Further, Pythium oospore formation was absent in the presence of P. fluorescens DR54. A striking effect on zoospore forming indigenous Fungi was also observed in microcosms with P. fluorescens DR54 and, thus, where viscosinamide could be detected; a large number of encysted zoospores were seen in such microcosms both with and without P. ultimum infections. In vitro studies confirmed that purified viscosinamide induced encystment of Pythium zoospores. (C) 2000 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

A fungus isolated from roots of C. macranthos var. rebunense induced symbiotic germination of the species in vitro. Cold treatment of the seeds at 4degreesC prior to fungal inoculation was required for the symbiotic germination. Changing the timing of inoculation of the fungus to the seeds greatly improved germination frequency. Maximum germination was attained after seeds were inoculated just after the cold treatment for 12 weeks, and approximately 20% of the seeds developed into protocorms more than 1 mm long. These results suggest that fungal inoculation takes place at the beginning of spring in nature, and the tough impervious seed coat may preserve the seed from the infection during autumn and winter seasons. The lengthy culture period of more than 16 weeks at 20degreesC on the same medium with the fungus caused gradual browning and rot of the protocorms. By elimination of the fungus with a fungicide and by transfer to a nutrient rich medium, approximately 20% of the protocorms developed into healthy plantlets.

Protocols for asymbiotic germination of orchid seeds typically use media with high concentrations of soluble carbohydrate and minerals. However, when reintroduced into the field, seedlings obtained via asymbiotic germination have lower survival rates than do seedlings obtained via symbiotic germination. Tree fern fiber, the ideal substrate for orchid seedling acclimatization, is increasingly scarce. Here, we evaluated seed germination and protocorm development of Cyrtopodium glutiniferum Raddi cultivated in asymbiotic media (Knudson C and Murashige & Skoog) and in oatmeal agar (OA) medium inoculated with the mycorrhizal fungus Epulorhiza sp., using non-inoculated OA medium as a control. We also evaluated the performance of tree fern fiber, pine bark, eucalyptus bark, corncob and sawdust as substrates for the acclimatization of symbiotically propagated plants. We determined germination percentages, protocorm development and growth indices at 35 and 70 days of cultivation. Relative growth rates and the effects of substrates on mycorrhizal formation were calculated after 165 days of cultivation. Germination efficiency and growth indices were best when inoculated OA medium was used. Corncob and pine bark showed the highest percentages of colonized system roots. The OA medium inoculated with Epulorhiza sp. shows potential for C. glutiniferum seedling production. Corncob and pine bark are promising substitutes for tree fern fiber as substrates for the acclimatization of orchid seedlings.

A range of different laboratory assays in regard to potential plant growth promotion was performed and strains were further evaluated for improving growth of five maize cultivars under axenic and natural soil conditions. Endophytic colonization was an additional component in our selection process as it is of high importance for an inoculant strain to efficiently colonize the plant environment. All strains had the potential to improve maize seedling growth under axenic conditions. Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed both the highest growth-promoting activity under axenic conditions as well as colonization capacity. FD17 was therefore selected for further plant tests in a net house, in which two different maize cultivars were grown in large pots until ripening and subjected to outdoor climatic conditions. Results showed that inoculation significantly increased plant biomass, number of leaves plant(-1), leaf area, and grain yield up to 39 %, 14 %, 20 %, and 42 %, respectively, as compared to the un-inoculated control. Similarly, inoculation also improved the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of maize plant and reduced the time needed for flowering. We also confirmed that strain FD17 is able to colonize the rhizosphere, roots and stems. Based on rigorous testing, Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed the highest potential to promote growth and health of maize grown under natural conditions. This study suggested that in vitro plant growth-promoting traits and potential of maize seedling growth promotion by bacterial endophytes could be used for the selection of potential inoculant strains subjected for further testing as bio-inoculant under field conditions.

A range of different laboratory assays in regard to potential plant growth promotion was performed and strains were further evaluated for improving growth of five maize cultivars under axenic and natural soil conditions. Endophytic colonization was an additional component in our selection process as it is of high importance for an inoculant strain to efficiently colonize the plant environment. All strains had the potential to improve maize seedling growth under axenic conditions. Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed both the highest growth-promoting activity under axenic conditions as well as colonization capacity. FD17 was therefore selected for further plant tests in a net house, in which two different maize cultivars were grown in large pots until ripening and subjected to outdoor climatic conditions. Results showed that inoculation significantly increased plant biomass, number of leaves plant(-1), leaf area, and grain yield up to 39 %, 14 %, 20 %, and 42 %, respectively, as compared to the un-inoculated control. Similarly, inoculation also improved the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of maize plant and reduced the time needed for flowering. We also confirmed that strain FD17 is able to colonize the rhizosphere, roots and stems. Based on rigorous testing, Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed the highest potential to promote growth and health of maize grown under natural conditions. This study suggested that in vitro plant growth-promoting traits and potential of maize seedling growth promotion by bacterial endophytes could be used for the selection of potential inoculant strains subjected for further testing as bio-inoculant under field conditions.

Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed both the highest growth-promoting activity under axenic conditions as well as colonization capacity. FD17 was therefore selected for further plant tests in a net house, in which two different maize cultivars were grown in large pots until ripening and subjected to outdoor climatic conditions. Results showed that inoculation significantly increased plant biomass, number of leaves plant(-1), leaf area, and grain yield up to 39 %, 14 %, 20 %, and 42 %, respectively, as compared to the un-inoculated control. Similarly, inoculation also improved the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of maize plant and reduced the time needed for flowering. We also confirmed that strain FD17 is able to colonize the rhizosphere, roots and stems. Based on rigorous testing, Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed the highest potential to promote growth and health of maize grown under natural conditions. This study suggested that in vitro plant growth-promoting traits and potential of maize seedling growth promotion by bacterial endophytes could be used for the selection of potential inoculant strains subjected for further testing as bio-inoculant under field conditions.

A range of different laboratory assays in regard to potential plant growth promotion was performed and strains were further evaluated for improving growth of five maize cultivars under axenic and natural soil conditions. Endophytic colonization was an additional component in our selection process as it is of high importance for an inoculant strain to efficiently colonize the plant environment. All strains had the potential to improve maize seedling growth under axenic conditions. Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed both the highest growth-promoting activity under axenic conditions as well as colonization capacity. FD17 was therefore selected for further plant tests in a net house, in which two different maize cultivars were grown in large pots until ripening and subjected to outdoor climatic conditions. Results showed that inoculation significantly increased plant biomass, number of leaves plant(-1), leaf area, and grain yield up to 39 %, 14 %, 20 %, and 42 %, respectively, as compared to the un-inoculated control. Similarly, inoculation also improved the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of maize plant and reduced the time needed for flowering. We also confirmed that strain FD17 is able to colonize the rhizosphere, roots and stems. Based on rigorous testing, Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed the highest potential to promote growth and health of maize grown under natural conditions.

A range of different laboratory assays in regard to potential plant growth promotion was performed and strains were further evaluated for improving growth of five maize cultivars under axenic and natural soil conditions. Endophytic colonization was an additional component in our selection process as it is of high importance for an inoculant strain to efficiently colonize the plant environment. All strains had the potential to improve maize seedling growth under axenic conditions. Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed both the highest growth-promoting activity under axenic conditions as well as colonization capacity. FD17 was therefore selected for further plant tests in a net house, in which two different maize cultivars were grown in large pots until ripening and subjected to outdoor climatic conditions. Results showed that inoculation significantly increased plant biomass, number of leaves plant(-1), leaf area, and grain yield up to 39 %, 14 %, 20 %, and 42 %, respectively, as compared to the un-inoculated control. Similarly, inoculation also improved the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of maize plant and reduced the time needed for flowering. We also confirmed that strain FD17 is able to colonize the rhizosphere, roots and stems. Based on rigorous testing, Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed the highest potential to promote growth and health of maize grown under natural conditions. This study suggested that in vitro plant growth-promoting traits and potential of maize seedling growth promotion by bacterial endophytes could be used for the selection of potential inoculant strains subjected for further testing as bio-inoculant under field conditions.

A range of different laboratory assays in regard to potential plant growth promotion was performed and strains were further evaluated for improving growth of five maize cultivars under axenic and natural soil conditions. Endophytic colonization was an additional component in our selection process as it is of high importance for an inoculant strain to efficiently colonize the plant environment. All strains had the potential to improve maize seedling growth under axenic conditions. Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed both the highest growth-promoting activity under axenic conditions as well as colonization capacity. FD17 was therefore selected for further plant tests in a net house, in which two different maize cultivars were grown in large pots until ripening and subjected to outdoor climatic conditions. Results showed that inoculation significantly increased plant biomass, number of leaves plant(-1), leaf area, and grain yield up to 39 %, 14 %, 20 %, and 42 %, respectively, as compared to the un-inoculated control. Similarly, inoculation also improved the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of maize plant and reduced the time needed for flowering. We also confirmed that strain FD17 is able to colonize the rhizosphere, roots and stems. Based on rigorous testing, Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed the highest potential to promote growth and health of maize grown under natural conditions. This study suggested that in vitro plant growth-promoting traits and potential of maize seedling growth promotion by bacterial endophytes could be used for the selection of potential inoculant strains subjected for further testing as bio-inoculant under field conditions.

We investigated this process using populations of teosinte, a wild annual grass related to maize (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), sampling plants from 10 sites along an elevational gradient as well as rhizosphere biota from three of those sites. We grew half-sibling teosinte families in each biota to test whether trait divergence among teosinte populations reflects adaptation or drift, and whether rhizosphere biota affect expression of diverged traits. We further assayed the influence of rhizosphere biota on contemporary additive genetic variation. We found that adaptation across environment shaped divergence of some traits, particularly flowering time and root biomass. We also observed that different rhizosphere biota shifted expressed values of these traits within teosinte populations and families and altered within-population genetic variance and covariance. In sum, our results imply that changes in trait expression and covariance elicited by rhizosphere communities could have played a historical role in teosinte adaptation to environments and that they are likely to play a role in the response to future selection.

We investigated this process using populations of teosinte, a wild annual grass related to maize (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), sampling plants from 10 sites along an elevational gradient as well as rhizosphere biota from three of those sites. We grew half-sibling teosinte families in each biota to test whether trait divergence among teosinte populations reflects adaptation or drift, and whether rhizosphere biota affect expression of diverged traits. We further assayed the influence of rhizosphere biota on contemporary additive genetic variation. We found that adaptation across environment shaped divergence of some traits, particularly flowering time and root biomass. We also observed that different rhizosphere biota shifted expressed values of these traits within teosinte populations and families and altered within-population genetic variance and covariance. In sum, our results imply that changes in trait expression and covariance elicited by rhizosphere communities could have played a historical role in teosinte adaptation to environments and that they are likely to play a role in the response to future selection.

We investigated this process using populations of teosinte, a wild annual grass related to maize (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), sampling plants from 10 sites along an elevational gradient as well as rhizosphere biota from three of those sites. We grew half-sibling teosinte families in each biota to test whether trait divergence among teosinte populations reflects adaptation or drift, and whether rhizosphere biota affect expression of diverged traits. We further assayed the influence of rhizosphere biota on contemporary additive genetic variation. We found that adaptation across environment shaped divergence of some traits, particularly flowering time and root biomass. We also observed that different rhizosphere biota shifted expressed values of these traits within teosinte populations and families and altered within-population genetic variance and covariance.

We investigated this process using populations of teosinte, a wild annual grass related to maize (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), sampling plants from 10 sites along an elevational gradient as well as rhizosphere biota from three of those sites. We grew half-sibling teosinte families in each biota to test whether trait divergence among teosinte populations reflects adaptation or drift, and whether rhizosphere biota affect expression of diverged traits. We further assayed the influence of rhizosphere biota on contemporary additive genetic variation. We found that adaptation across environment shaped divergence of some traits, particularly flowering time and root biomass. We also observed that different rhizosphere biota shifted expressed values of these traits within teosinte populations and families and altered within-population genetic variance and covariance. In sum, our results imply that changes in trait expression and covariance elicited by rhizosphere communities could have played a historical role in teosinte adaptation to environments and that they are likely to play a role in the response to future selection.

We investigated this process using populations of teosinte, a wild annual grass related to maize (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), sampling plants from 10 sites along an elevational gradient as well as rhizosphere biota from three of those sites. We grew half-sibling teosinte families in each biota to test whether trait divergence among teosinte populations reflects adaptation or drift, and whether rhizosphere biota affect expression of diverged traits. We further assayed the influence of rhizosphere biota on contemporary additive genetic variation. We found that adaptation across environment shaped divergence of some traits, particularly flowering time and root biomass. We also observed that different rhizosphere biota shifted expressed values of these traits within teosinte populations and families and altered within-population genetic variance and covariance.

We investigated this process using populations of teosinte, a wild annual grass related to maize (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), sampling plants from 10 sites along an elevational gradient as well as rhizosphere biota from three of those sites. We grew half-sibling teosinte families in each biota to test whether trait divergence among teosinte populations reflects adaptation or drift, and whether rhizosphere biota affect expression of diverged traits. We further assayed the influence of rhizosphere biota on contemporary additive genetic variation. We found that adaptation across environment shaped divergence of some traits, particularly flowering time and root biomass. We also observed that different rhizosphere biota shifted expressed values of these traits within teosinte populations and families and altered within-population genetic variance and covariance. In sum, our results imply that changes in trait expression and covariance elicited by rhizosphere communities could have played a historical role in teosinte adaptation to environments and that they are likely to play a role in the response to future selection.

Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were extracted from weathered soil (60.7 g of TPH kg(-1) of dry soil) and spiked on perlite at initial concentration of 5 g of TPH kg(-1) of dry perlite. Phenological characteristics, total microbial viable counts, hydrocarbon degraders and residual hydrocarbons were determined through 180 days of culture. Phenological characteristics of inoculated plants were improved as compared with non-inoculated plants: root biomass was 1.6 times greater, flowering time was reduced (13%), and the number of inflorescences was 1.5 times higher. The rhizospheric bacterial and fungi counts were higher for planted treatments (inoculated and not inoculated) than for unplanted pots. The maximum phytoremediation rate (0.51 mg of TPH g(-1) of dry plant d(-1)) for inoculated plants was reached at 60 days of culture, and was two times higher than for non-inoculated plants (55% TPH removal). Similar hydrocarbon phytoremediation extent values for inoculated (90%) and non-inoculated (85%) plants were obtained at 180 days of culture. The present study demonstrated that mutual benefits between C laxus and inoculated hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms are improved during phytoremediation. It is pertinent to note that this is the first report of hydrocarbon phytoremediation by Cyperus laxus Lam., a native plant growing in highly contaminated swamps. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Response of bio-fertilizers and commercial formulations on growth, yield and corm production of gladiolus	INDIAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURE			English	Article						Bio-fertilizers; commercial spray formulations; yield; gladiolus		Field experiments were conducted to study the effect of various bio-fertilizers and commercial formulations on growth and development of gladiolus. The results showed that early sprouting of corm (17.10 days) was obtained by Azotobacter, maximum number of leaves (11.33) was produced by Azospirillum, maximum plant height (161.8 cm) was obtained by phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB), early flowering (81 days) was recorded by Annapurna (R), maximum diameter of floret (9.43 cm) was observed by PSB, maximum number of florets per spike (12.33) was recorded by Annapurna (R). Significant increase in spike length (80.33 cm) was obtained by Sumangala (R), maximum rachis length (54.67 cm) was obtained by both Annapurana (R) and Azotobacter, maximum number of corms per plant (2.90) was observed by Azospirillum, maximum number of cormels (7.30), maximum weight of corm (44.93 g), maximum weight of cormels per plant (10.40 g), maximum volume of corm (51.17 cm(3)), maximum corm diameter (5.67 cm) and maximum value of propagation co-efficient (231%) was obtained by the application of Flower Booster (R). Application of bio-fertilizers and commercial spray formulation products not only improved the qualitative and quantitative parameters but also improved the soil fertility and productivity.

Host genotype overrides fungal endophyte infection in influencing tiller and spike production of Lolium perenne (Poaceae) in a common garden experiment	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						common garden; endophytic fungi; flowering; infection intensity; Neotyphodium lolii; perennial ryegrass; population ecology; tiller production	NEOTYPHODIUM ENDOPHYTES; ACREMONIUM-LOLII; DROUGHT-STRESS; SEED YIELD; RYEGRASS; GROWTH; PLANT; SYMBIOSIS; POPULATIONS; ENVIRONMENT	Leaves of many cool-season grasses are infected by endophytic fungi that call impact their Populations. A common garden experiment with Lolium perenne was established in a lawn in New Jersey, USA, to investigate the impact of endophyte infection and host genotype on tiller and spike production over three years. Infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants of each genotype were monitored every 2-3 mo. Infection intensity within plants varied significantly among genotypes and years, but there was no evidence of directional chan-e over time. Tiller production varied significantly among, genotypes and was affected by endophytes: E+ plants of several genotypes produced more tillers than E-plants during the third year. E+ plants had greater aboveground biomass. but host genotype explained a far greater proportion of variation in tiller production, number, and biomass than infection. Plant survival, percentage flowering, flowering date, number of spikes, and mean tiller mass were unaffected by endophytes. However, the last three variables showed significant variation among host genotypes. Although Studies have demonstrated a positive growth effect of endophytes oil several grass hosts. in this experiment host genotype accounted for far more of the variation in tiller and spike production and in biomass of Lolium perenne than endophyte infection.

Host genotype overrides fungal endophyte infection in influencing tiller and spike production of Lolium perenne (Poaceae) in a common garden experiment	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						common garden; endophytic fungi; flowering; infection intensity; Neotyphodium lolii; perennial ryegrass; population ecology; tiller production	NEOTYPHODIUM ENDOPHYTES; ACREMONIUM-LOLII; DROUGHT-STRESS; SEED YIELD; RYEGRASS; GROWTH; PLANT; SYMBIOSIS; POPULATIONS; ENVIRONMENT	Leaves of many cool-season grasses are infected by endophytic fungi that call impact their Populations. A common garden experiment with Lolium perenne was established in a lawn in New Jersey, USA, to investigate the impact of endophyte infection and host genotype on tiller and spike production over three years. Infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants of each genotype were monitored every 2-3 mo. Infection intensity within plants varied significantly among genotypes and years, but there was no evidence of directional chan-e over time. Tiller production varied significantly among, genotypes and was affected by endophytes: E+ plants of several genotypes produced more tillers than E-plants during the third year. E+ plants had greater aboveground biomass. but host genotype explained a far greater proportion of variation in tiller production, number, and biomass than infection. Plant survival, percentage flowering, flowering date, number of spikes, and mean tiller mass were unaffected by endophytes. However, the last three variables showed significant variation among host genotypes. Although Studies have demonstrated a positive growth effect of endophytes oil several grass hosts. in this experiment host genotype accounted for far more of the variation in tiller and spike production and in biomass of Lolium perenne than endophyte infection.

The application of A. brasilense to the seed can reduce the emergence percentage and the emergence speed index of corn seedlings, depending on the genotype, but its application does not influence the initial growth of the plants. The A. brasilense inoculation via seed and via sowing furrow can reduce the emergence and increase the mean emergence time of sorghum seedlings, depending on the genotype. The A. brasilense inoculation via seed results in an increase in the dry mass of the root system of sorghum plants.

The first factor consisted of a control treatment (without inoculation) and three inoculation methods: via seed, via sowing furrow and via leaf spray. The second factor was composed by two hybrids of corn and two of sorghum. The application of A. brasilense to the seed can reduce the emergence percentage and the emergence speed index of corn seedlings, depending on the genotype, but its application does not influence the initial growth of the plants. The A. brasilense inoculation via seed and via sowing furrow can reduce the emergence and increase the mean emergence time of sorghum seedlings, depending on the genotype. The A. brasilense inoculation via seed results in an increase in the dry mass of the root system of sorghum plants.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time.

We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype.

Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time.

We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype.

Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time.

We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

Using field-collected soil and seeds of the perennial bunchgrass Elymus canadensis, we tested the hypothesis that soil freeze-thaw events limit survival within the soil through direct effects on seed persistence and amplification of soil pathogen attack using a factorial experiment that manipulated freeze-thaw cycles (constant freeze vs. freeze-thaw) and fungicide addition. Freeze-thaw treatment resulted in lower seedling emergence and delayed emergence time relative to constant-freeze controls. Fungicide-treated soils had greater emergence relative to untreated soils; the lowest seedling emergence was observed in no-fungicide, freeze-thaw-treated soils (< 1 %). The strong effects of thermal variability and fungi on seeds were mitigated through interactions at the seed-soil interface, as subsequent experiments showed that fungicide and freeze-thaw treatments alone do not influence dormancy. Our work demonstrates that changes in freeze-thaw events directly limit seedling emergence, delay seedling phenology, and provide opportunities for fungal pathogens to limit seed persistence. As recruitment from seeds is a key determinant of plant population dynamics, these results suggest that climatic variation may generate unique consequences for populations under changing climate regimes.

The effect of osmotic potential on percent germination and time to germination for big sacaton (Sporobolus wrightii Munro) and Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey) was investigated. We predicted that seeds native to semi-arid environments would germinate at osmotic potentials less negative than about -1.5 MPa, the permanent wilting point (PWP) of many agronomic grasses. In addition, the systemic, asexual endophyte Neotyphodium is transmitted through the seed in Arizona fescue and is thought to increase germination of its host. Therefore, we also tested for an effect of the endophyte on germination and time to germination of Arizona fescue under varying osmotic potentials. To test for minimum osmotic potential supporting germination, big sacaton and Arizona fescue seeds were placed on acetate membranes in contact with PEG solutions of varying osmotic potentials for 2 weeks. Both grasses germinated at 50% of maximum germination (at soil saturation) at and below the standard PWP (-1.5 Mpa). Big sacaton and Arizona fescue germinated at 64% and 60% at -1.5 MPa, respectively, and Arizona fescue germinated at 35% at -1.8 MPa (70% was the maximum at saturation). The presence of the Neotyphodium endophyte did not affect percent or time to germination of Arizona fescue at any of the osmotic potentials tested.

Genotype-specific effects of ericoid mycorrhizae on floral traits and reproduction in Vaccinium corymbosum	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						belowground and aboveground interactions; context-dependence; Ericaceae; ericoid mycorrhizae; floral traits; genotype-specific effects; pollination; pollen limitation; symbiosis; Vaccinium corymbosum	BOMBUS-IMPATIENS HYMENOPTERA; BELOW-GROUND MUTUALISM; BEES HYMENOPTERA; CONTEXT-DEPENDENCY; PLANT REPRODUCTION; POLLEN LIMITATION; FRUIT PRODUCTION; DISPLAY SIZE; BLUEBERRY; POLLINATION	Premise Most plants interact with mycorrhizal fungi and animal pollinators simultaneously. Yet, whether mycorrhizae affect traits important to pollination remains poorly understood and may depend on the match between host and fungal genotypes. Here, we examined how ericoid mycorrhizal fungi affected flowering phenology, floral traits, and reproductive success, among eight genotypes of highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum (Ericaceae). We asked three overarching questions: (1) Do genotypes differ in response to inoculation? (2) How does inoculation affect floral and flowering traits? (3) Are inoculated plants more attractive to pollinators and less pollen limited than non-inoculated plants of the same genotype? Methods To examine these questions, we experimentally inoculated plants with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, grew the plants in the field, and measured flowering and floral traits over 2 years. In year 2, we conducted a hand-pollination experiment to test whether plants differed in pollen limitation. Results Inoculated plants had significantly higher levels of colonization for some genotypes, and there were significant floral trait changes in inoculated plants for some genotypes as well. On average, inoculated plants produced significantly larger floral displays, more fruits per inflorescence, and heavier fruits with lower sugar content, than non-inoculated, control plants. Hand pollination enhanced the production of fruits, and fruit mass, for non-inoculated plants but not for those that were inoculated. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi enhanced flowering and altered investment in reproduction in genotype-specific ways. These findings underscore the importance of examining belowground symbionts and genotype-specific responses in their hosts to fully understand the drivers of aboveground interactions.

Here, by using a sterile experimental system, we demonstrate that Sphingomonas sp. Cra20 promotes the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana by driving developmental plasticity in the roots, thus stimulating the growth of lateral roots and root hairs. By investigating the growth dynamics of A. thaliana in soil with different water-content, we demonstrate that Cra20 increases the growth rate of plants, but does not change the time of reproductive transition under well-water condition. The results further show that the application of Cra20 changes the rhizosphere indigenous bacterial community, which may be due to the change in root structure. Our findings provide new insights into the complex mechanisms of plant and bacterial interactions. The ability to promote the growth of plants under water-deficit can contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture.

From this data the proportion of plants flowering was calculated and the susceptibility of each ecotype to individual isolate was quantified. The A. thaliana ecotypes were inoculated by several isolates of V. dahliae and V. longisporum with the disease symptoms observed being similar to those characteristic of Verticillium-infected Brassica napus. Responses to Verticillium isolates varied and for both ecotypes significant differences (P less than or equal to 0.05) were recorded in days to flowering between the V. longisporum isolates VD6 and VD12 and the V. dahliae isolate INRA617 and all other isolates. There were no other significant effects correlated with isolate origin or Verticillium species.

Two-week-old seedlings of two A. thaliana ecotypes were inoculated with conidial suspensions (1.6 x 10(4) conidia/ml) and maintained in sterile conditions on microtitre plates for 25 days. The seedlings were assessed daily for flowering time, height at flowering and mortality. From this data the proportion of plants flowering was calculated and the susceptibility of each ecotype to individual isolate was quantified. The A. thaliana ecotypes were inoculated by several isolates of V. dahliae and V. longisporum with the disease symptoms observed being similar to those characteristic of Verticillium-infected Brassica napus. Responses to Verticillium isolates varied and for both ecotypes significant differences (P less than or equal to 0.05) were recorded in days to flowering between the V. longisporum isolates VD6 and VD12 and the V. dahliae isolate INRA617 and all other isolates.

Rapid responses of soil microorganisms improve plant fitness in novel environments	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						plant-microbe interaction; contemporary evolution; climate change; phenology; species interaction	RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES; ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS; CONTEMPORARY EVOLUTION; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; STRESS TOLERANCE; CHANGE IMPACTS; FOREST SOIL	Global change is challenging plant and animal populations with novel environmental conditions, including increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warmer temperatures, and altered precipitation regimes. In some cases, contemporary or rapid evolution can ameliorate the effects of global change. However, the direction and magnitude of evolutionary responses may be contingent upon interactions with other community members that also are experiencing novel environmental conditions. Here, we examine plant adaptation to drought stress in a multigeneration experiment that manipulated aboveground-belowground feedbacks between plants and soil microbial communities. Although drought stress reduced plant growth and accelerated plant phenologies, surprisingly, plant evolutionary responses to drought were relatively weak. In contrast, plant fitness in both drought and nondrought environments was linked strongly to the rapid responses of soil microbial community structure to moisture manipulations. Specifically, plants were most fit when their contemporary environmental conditions (wet vs. dry soil) matched the historical environmental conditions (wet vs. dry soil) of their associated microbial community. Together, our findings suggest that, when faced with environmental change, plants may not be limited to adapt or migrate strategies; instead, they also may benefit from association with interacting species, especially diverse soil microbial communities, that respond rapidly to environmental change.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE			English	Article						purple loosestrife; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; plant reproduction	LYCOPERSICON-ESCULENTUM MILL; PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE; INFECTION; FIELD; WILD	Lythrum salicaria L., purple loosestrife, is a heterostylous, perennial plant with prolific and at times invasive vegetative growth and sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction occurs following pollination and fertilization between two different floral morphs. We investigated the influence of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Glomus aggregatum Schenck and Smith emend. Koske, on the vegetative growth and sexual reproductive potential of L. salicaria. Mycorrhiza decreased plant biomass both aboveground and belowground. Flower production, number of days to anthesis, numbers of flowers per inflorescence, and inflorescence lengths were not significantly different between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal treatments. However, pollen production per anther and per flower increased with mycorrhizal colonization. Though ovule production was not affected, some aspects of purple loosestrife morphology did change. Plants with mycorrhizae produced inflorescence (in lateral positions) further up the stem. In addition, flower distribution within an inflorescence differed according to morph (short, mid, and long style) such that in the mid and long morphs flower number increased with inflorescence length and was unevenly distributed, while in the short morph this distribution appeared even. The relative biomass of stems, leaves, lateral branches, and reproductive structures were not significantly different in mycorrhizal plants, whereas in the absence of mycorrhizal colonization, stem biomass was higher relative to other structures. This study suggests some vegetative and reproductive characteristics in purple loosestrife change with an association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

In this research we evaluated the effect of ten indigenous rhizobial isolates on the germination and growth of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) during seedling stage to produce more vigorous plants. One hundred seeds were planted/treatment in triplicate and inoculated with the bacterial cultures (1x10(8) cel.mL(-1)) plus a non-inoculated control, recording the germination during 8 days. Fifteen seedlings were transplanted/treatment to propagation trays with an inert sterile substrate, reinoculated and maintained for 30-45 days, to evaluate the effect on growth. The results were analyzed by Anova and compared with the control. The isolates RmBorbollon and ME01 were the most efficient to promote germination (P <= 0,05) in bell pepper. No effect was found for lettuce germination. The isolates ME01 and Med increased significantly (P <= 0,05) most growth variables in bell pepper and just a few in lettuce, which suggests some specificity of action between microorganisms and plant species. The strains were identified as belonging to the genera Ochrobactrum, Bradyrhizobium and Pseudomonas. It is concluded that these isolates, at exerting their promoter effect, may constitute promising strains for the formulation of biofertilizers.

Microbial mitigation-exacerbation continuum: a novel framework for microbiome effects on hosts in the face of stress	ECOLOGY			English	Article						allelopathy; habitat specialization; microbial mitigation; microbiome; plant-soil feedbacks; rosemary scrub; species distributions; stress gradient hypothesis	CERATIOLA-ERICOIDES EMPETRACEAE; GRADIENT HYPOTHESIS; PLANT; COMPETITION; FACILITATION; MICROORGANISMS; COMMUNITIES; GERMINATION; BENEFITS; FEEDBACK	A key challenge to understanding microbiomes and their role in ecological processes is contextualizing their effects on host organisms, particularly when faced with environmental stress. One influential theory, the Stress Gradient Hypothesis, might predict that the frequency of positive interactions increases with stressful conditions such that microbial taxa would mitigate harmful effects on host performance.

Here, we introduce the Mitigation-Exacerbation Continuum as a novel framework to conceptualize microbial mediation of stress. We (1) use this continuum to quantify microbial mediation of stress for six plant species and (2) test the association between these continuum values and natural species' abundance. We factorially manipulated a common stress (allelopathy) and the presence of soil microbes to quantify microbial effects in benign and stressed environments for two critical early life-history metrics, seed germination and seedling biomass. Although we found evidence of both mitigation and exacerbation among the six species, exacerbation was more common. Across species, the degree of microbial-mediated effects on germination explained >80% of the variation of natural field abundances. Our results suggest a critical role of soil microbes in mediating plant stress responses, and a potential microbial mechanism underlying species abundance.

Microbial mitigation-exacerbation continuum: a novel framework for microbiome effects on hosts in the face of stress	ECOLOGY			English	Article						allelopathy; habitat specialization; microbial mitigation; microbiome; plant-soil feedbacks; rosemary scrub; species distributions; stress gradient hypothesis	CERATIOLA-ERICOIDES EMPETRACEAE; GRADIENT HYPOTHESIS; PLANT; COMPETITION; FACILITATION; MICROORGANISMS; COMMUNITIES; GERMINATION; BENEFITS; FEEDBACK	A key challenge to understanding microbiomes and their role in ecological processes is contextualizing their effects on host organisms, particularly when faced with environmental stress. One influential theory, the Stress Gradient Hypothesis, might predict that the frequency of positive interactions increases with stressful conditions such that microbial taxa would mitigate harmful effects on host performance. Yet, equally plausible is that microbial taxa could exacerbate these effects. Here, we introduce the Mitigation-Exacerbation Continuum as a novel framework to conceptualize microbial mediation of stress. We (1) use this continuum to quantify microbial mediation of stress for six plant species and (2) test the association between these continuum values and natural species' abundance. We factorially manipulated a common stress (allelopathy) and the presence of soil microbes to quantify microbial effects in benign and stressed environments for two critical early life-history metrics, seed germination and seedling biomass. Although we found evidence of both mitigation and exacerbation among the six species, exacerbation was more common. Across species, the degree of microbial-mediated effects on germination explained >80% of the variation of natural field abundances. Our results suggest a critical role of soil microbes in mediating plant stress responses, and a potential microbial mechanism underlying species abundance.

The analysis of variance revealed the existence of significant amount of genetic variability in the material for all the traits. All the genotypes were treated with three treatments separately (Mesorhizobium sp. Strain CH 1233 (S1); Mesorhizobium sp. Strain CH 810 (S2); vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) (Glomus fasiculatum) and one set was used as uninoculated control. These were grown separately following randomized block design with three replications in each treatment. Comparative analysis indicated the differences between the treatments and behaviour of the genotypes in different environments. In general S1 and VAM showed beneficial interaction for maximum number of traits for all the genotypes. The effect of VAM was the most apparent among treatments. On overall basis, genotypes viz. HC 3, HC 5, GL 94022, ICC 5003LN, HK 2, GNG 663 and BG 362 were observed to be better performing and responsive to bio inoculants having one or more superior traits. These genotypes performing better for specific traits can be used as parents in hybridization programme for improvement of that particular trait.

The strain readily formed arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) with the roots of strawberry 'Zoji' (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.

Compared with uninoculated strawberries, inoculation increased plant dry weight by 31%, as well as nitrogen content (47%), phosphorus content (57%), and photosynthetic rate (71%). AM inoculation also shortened the blossom and ripening date by 3 and 4 days, respectively. This is the first report of a P. pinophilum strain resulting in mycorrhiza with strawberry roots.

In this work, Diversispora spurca, D. versiformis, and Funneliformis mosseae were applied to rhizosphere of potted hyacinth (Hyacinths orientalis L. Anna Marie) plants. After four months of mycorrhizal inoculation, root could be colonized by exogenous AMF species, varied from 38% to 49%, whilst F. mosseae had the best mycorrhizal status. Out of these AMF species used, only F. mosseae- inoculated plants recorded greater raceme length and biomass production of single flowerlet, raceme, and flower stem. F. mosseae also induced the flowering earlier in 2 days and prolonged flowering time for 3 days. D. versiformis postponed 2 days for flowering. Mycorrhizal plants recorded considerably higher acetic acid (IAA) and zeatin riboside (ZR) levels in flowers, irrespective of AMF species. F. mosseae-inoculated plants had significantly higher methyl jasmonate (MeJA) concentrations in flowers than other AMF- or non-AMF-treated plants. These results thereby conclude that F. mosseae can be used to regulate flowering of H. orientalis L. Anna Marie, including flowering earlier and prolonging flowering time, which is closely associated with IAA, ZR and MeJA levels in flowers.

Here, we test this hypothesis with factorial experiments addressing the role of microbes in local adaptation of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) to stressful limestone barrens (alvars) compared to neighboring old-fields. Alvar plants benefited more from microbes in early life history stages, while at later growth stages, alvar and old-field plants benefited equally from microbes but only in the old-field habitat. Patterns of local adaptation were changed by the presence of microbes. Alvar plants grown in association with alvar microbes outperformed old-field plants in the alvar habitat, whereas old-field plants showed patterns of maladaptation when grown with microbes. In this demonstration of microbe-mediated adaptation, we show that rhizosphere microbes can be important for plant fitness and patterns of local adaptation but that those effects are dependent on life-history stage and habitat.

Effects of fertilizer, fungal endophytes and plant cultivar on the performance of insect herbivores and their natural enemies	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						cereal aphids; endophytic fungi; Neotyphodium lolii; parasitoids; trophic cascades	LOLIUM-PERENNE; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; TALL FESCUE; LOLITREM-B; ACREMONIUM ENDOPHYTE; ARIZONA FESCUE; HOST GENOTYPE; PERAMINE; GRASSES; RYEGRASS	1. Endophytic fungi are associates of most species of plants and may modify insect community structures through the production of toxic alkaloids. Fertilization is known to increase food plant quality for herbivores, but it is also conceivable that additional nitrogen could increase the production of the insect toxic alkaloid, peramine, in endophyte-infected plants. 2. The relative importance of soil fertility and endophyte infection on herbivores and their natural enemies is unknown. As performance of the host plant is often affected by an interaction between endophyte infection and genetic background, four different plant cultivars were tested. The main questions addressed in this study were whether plant cultivar and fertilizer addition to endophyte-infected and endophyte-free Lolium perenne affect alkaloid concentrations, plant life-history traits and the abundances of aphid species and their parasitoids. 3. In a full factorial outdoor experiment we found a strong positive effect of fertilizer on plant biomass and on the abundance of aphids and parasitoids. While plant traits differed between cultivars, there was little effect of cultivar on either aphid or parasitoid abundance. Only endophyte-infected plants contained alkaloids, and the concentration of peramine was enhanced in fertilized plants. However, endophyte infection had no negative effect on aphid or parasitoid abundances.

Endophytic fungi are associates of most species of plants and may modify insect community structures through the production of toxic alkaloids. Fertilization is known to increase food plant quality for herbivores, but it is also conceivable that additional nitrogen could increase the production of the insect toxic alkaloid, peramine, in endophyte-infected plants. 2. The relative importance of soil fertility and endophyte infection on herbivores and their natural enemies is unknown. As performance of the host plant is often affected by an interaction between endophyte infection and genetic background, four different plant cultivars were tested. The main questions addressed in this study were whether plant cultivar and fertilizer addition to endophyte-infected and endophyte-free Lolium perenne affect alkaloid concentrations, plant life-history traits and the abundances of aphid species and their parasitoids. 3. In a full factorial outdoor experiment we found a strong positive effect of fertilizer on plant biomass and on the abundance of aphids and parasitoids. While plant traits differed between cultivars, there was little effect of cultivar on either aphid or parasitoid abundance. Only endophyte-infected plants contained alkaloids, and the concentration of peramine was enhanced in fertilized plants. However, endophyte infection had no negative effect on aphid or parasitoid abundances. Plant traits were only weakly influenced by endophyte infection in the field, which contrasts with plant growth room studies, where both germination rate and plant height were influenced by endophyte-cultivar interactions. 4.

The availability of tomato ripening mutants has revealed many aspects of the genetics behind fleshy fruit ripening, plant hormones and light signal reception. Since previous analyses revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis influences tomato berry ripening, we wanted to test the hypothesis that an interplay might occur between root symbiosis and fruit ripening. With this aim, we screened seven tomato mutants affected in the ripening process for their responsiveness to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Following their phenological responses we selected two mutants for a deeper analysis: Green ripe (Gr), deficient in fruit ethylene perception and high-pigment-1 (hp-1), displaying enhanced light signal perception throughout the plant. We investigated the putative interactions between ripening processes, mycorrhizal establishment and systemic effects using biochemical and gene expression tools. Our experiments showed that both mutants, notwithstanding a normal mycorrhizal phenotype at root level, exhibit altered arbuscule functionality. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type, mycorrhization did not lead to a higher phosphate concentration in berries of both mutants. These results suggest that the mutations considered interfere with arbuscular mycorrhiza inducing systemic changes in plant phenology and fruits metabolism. We hypothesize a cross talk mechanism between AM and ripening processes that involves genes related to ethylene and light signaling.

The availability of tomato ripening mutants has revealed many aspects of the genetics behind fleshy fruit ripening, plant hormones and light signal reception. Since previous analyses revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis influences tomato berry ripening, we wanted to test the hypothesis that an interplay might occur between root symbiosis and fruit ripening. With this aim, we screened seven tomato mutants affected in the ripening process for their responsiveness to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Following their phenological responses we selected two mutants for a deeper analysis: Green ripe (Gr), deficient in fruit ethylene perception and high-pigment-1 (hp-1), displaying enhanced light signal perception throughout the plant. We investigated the putative interactions between ripening processes, mycorrhizal establishment and systemic effects using biochemical and gene expression tools. Our experiments showed that both mutants, notwithstanding a normal mycorrhizal phenotype at root level, exhibit altered arbuscule functionality. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type, mycorrhization did not lead to a higher phosphate concentration in berries of both mutants. These results suggest that the mutations considered interfere with arbuscular mycorrhiza inducing systemic changes in plant phenology and fruits metabolism. We hypothesize a cross talk mechanism between AM and ripening processes that involves genes related to ethylene and light signaling.

Metal-tolerant plants growing on metalliferous soils are fascinating genetic and microbial resources. Seeds can vertically transmit endophytic microorganisms that can assist next generations to cope with environmental stresses, through yet poorly understood mechanisms. The aims of this study were to identify the core seed endophyte microbiome of the pioneer metallophyte Crotalaria pumila throughout three generations, and to better understand the plant colonisation of the seed endophyte Methylobacterium sp. Cp3. Strain Cp3 was detected in C. pumila seeds across three successive generations and showed the most dominant community member. When inoculated in the soil at the time of flowering, strain Cp3 migrated from soil to seeds. Using confocal microscopy, Cp3-mCherry was demonstrated to colonise the root cortex cells and xylem vessels of the stem under metal stress. Moreover, strain Cp3 showed genetic and in planta potential to promote seed germination and seedling development. We revealed, for the first time, that the seed microbiome of a pioneer plant growing in its natural environment, and the colonisation behaviour of an important plant growth promoting systemic seed endophyte. Future characterization of seed microbiota will lead to a better understanding of their functional contribution and the potential use for seed-fortification applications.

In polythene-house trials ZYMV:WK inoculated plants were up to 10 days later in flowering than uninoculated plants and their cumulative yields were between 5% and 26% less than uninoculated plants depending on the cultivar. In most field trials cumulative yields from inoculated plants were between 4% and 38% less than uninoculated plants depending on the site and cultivar, but in one trial the yield was 7% higher from inoculated plants. In all experiments, courgette and marrow fruits harvested from ZYMV:WK inoculated plants were symptomless and indistinguishable from fruit harvested from uninoculated plants. The mild leaf symptoms induced by ZYMV:WK infection did not intensify to severe leaf symptoms and where there were natural outbreaks of severe ZYMV infection, fruits from inoculated plants remained symptomless whilst those from uninoculated plants were severely affected and unmarketable.

Cultivation-based studies were undertaken on two tomato cultivars Arka Vikas and Arka Abha employing surface sterilized seeds, aseptically germinated seeds and in vitro grown seedlings at different stages. Bacillus sp. appeared primarily as seed externally-associated bacteria. Tissue homogenate from extensively surface-sterilized seeds, day-3 germinating seeds, or 10-day in vitro seedlings did not show any cultivable bacteria on two bacteriological media. Indexing of 4-week old healthy seedlings with seed-coat removal following seed germination showed bacterial association in 50-75% seedlings yielding 10(6)-10(7) cfu g(-1) tissues. Four endophytic bacteria appeared common to both cultivars (Kosakonia, Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Sphingobium spp.) with three additional species in Arka Abha. The bacterial strains showed a manifold increase in growth with host-tissue-extract supplementation. Seed inoculations with single-isolates stimulated germination or enhanced the seedling growth coupled with the activation of additional endophytic bacteria. In vitro seedlings upon recurrent medium-indexing over eight weeks showed gradual emergence of endophytic bacteria. The study reveals the seed internal colonization by different bacterial endophytes in a cultivation-recalcitrant form, their activation to cultivable state during seedling growth and transmission to seedlings with mutualistic effects.

Cultivation-based studies were undertaken on two tomato cultivars Arka Vikas and Arka Abha employing surface sterilized seeds, aseptically germinated seeds and in vitro grown seedlings at different stages. Bacillus sp. appeared primarily as seed externally-associated bacteria. Tissue homogenate from extensively surface-sterilized seeds, day-3 germinating seeds, or 10-day in vitro seedlings did not show any cultivable bacteria on two bacteriological media. Indexing of 4-week old healthy seedlings with seed-coat removal following seed germination showed bacterial association in 50-75% seedlings yielding 10(6)-10(7) cfu g(-1) tissues. Four endophytic bacteria appeared common to both cultivars (Kosakonia, Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Sphingobium spp.) with three additional species in Arka Abha. The bacterial strains showed a manifold increase in growth with host-tissue-extract supplementation. Seed inoculations with single-isolates stimulated germination or enhanced the seedling growth coupled with the activation of additional endophytic bacteria. In vitro seedlings upon recurrent medium-indexing over eight weeks showed gradual emergence of endophytic bacteria. The study reveals the seed internal colonization by different bacterial endophytes in a cultivation-recalcitrant form, their activation to cultivable state during seedling growth and transmission to seedlings with mutualistic effects.

Cultivation-based studies were undertaken on two tomato cultivars Arka Vikas and Arka Abha employing surface sterilized seeds, aseptically germinated seeds and in vitro grown seedlings at different stages. Bacillus sp. appeared primarily as seed externally-associated bacteria. Tissue homogenate from extensively surface-sterilized seeds, day-3 germinating seeds, or 10-day in vitro seedlings did not show any cultivable bacteria on two bacteriological media. Indexing of 4-week old healthy seedlings with seed-coat removal following seed germination showed bacterial association in 50-75% seedlings yielding 10(6)-10(7) cfu g(-1) tissues. Four endophytic bacteria appeared common to both cultivars (Kosakonia, Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Sphingobium spp.) with three additional species in Arka Abha. The bacterial strains showed a manifold increase in growth with host-tissue-extract supplementation. Seed inoculations with single-isolates stimulated germination or enhanced the seedling growth coupled with the activation of additional endophytic bacteria. In vitro seedlings upon recurrent medium-indexing over eight weeks showed gradual emergence of endophytic bacteria. The study reveals the seed internal colonization by different bacterial endophytes in a cultivation-recalcitrant form, their activation to cultivable state during seedling growth and transmission to seedlings with mutualistic effects.

Soil microbes play an important role in promoting native establishment and are often added to restoration sites during seed sowing. We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

Soil microbes play an important role in promoting native establishment and are often added to restoration sites during seed sowing. We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

Soil microbes play an important role in promoting native establishment and are often added to restoration sites during seed sowing. We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

Soil microbes play an important role in promoting native establishment and are often added to restoration sites during seed sowing. We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

Soil microbes play an important role in promoting native establishment and are often added to restoration sites during seed sowing. We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

Soil microbes play an important role in promoting native establishment and are often added to restoration sites during seed sowing. We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

Plant association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been considered a factor increasing plant tolerance to herbivory. However, this positive effect could decrease with colonization density if the benefit : cost ratio of the AMF-plant association changes. We measured plant performance and tolerance to defoliation across a gradient of commercial AMF (Glomus sp.) inoculum concentration. 2. Six genetic families of Datura stramonium were grown under greenhouse conditions and subjected to five increasing levels of AMF inoculum concentration and to defoliation treatments, i.e. the presence/absence of 50% artificial damage, following a full-factorial design. 3. AMF colonization increased linearly with inoculum concentration while foliar area, root mass, flowering phenology and seed production expressed nonlinear functions. Plant genetic variation in the benefit function of AMF colonization was also detected. We show a negative interaction between AMF concentration and plant tolerance to defoliation. 4. Synthesis. The negative correlation between plant tolerance and AMF concentration suggests that defoliation can reduce AMF benefits and that natural variations in AMF can limit the evolution of optimum levels of tolerance. Moreover, genetic variation in the shape of the reaction norms to AMF in the presence/absence of defoliation suggests that plants may evolve in response to variation in densities of AMF and herbivores.

Phylogenetically isolated host-plants might share few mutualists with their neighbours and might suffer from a decrease in mutualist support. In addition host plants leaving their ancestral niche might face a deterioration of their abiotic and biotic environment and might hence need to invest more into mutualist partners. We tested whether phylogenetic isolation of hosts from neighbours decreases or increases abundance and activity of their mutualists and whether mutualist activity may help to compensate deterioration of the environment. We study oak-hosts and their ectomycorrhizal fungi mutualists established in the litter layer formed by the phylogenetically closely or distantly related neighbourhood. We find that oaks surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours show increased abundance and enzymatic activity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the litter. Moreover, oaks surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours also show delayed budburst but ectomycorrhizal fungi activity partly compensates this negative effect of phylogenetic isolation. This suggests decreased nutrient availability in a phylogenetically distant litter partly compensated by increased litter-degradation by ectomycorrhizal fungi activity. Most observed effects of phylogenetic isolation cannot be explained by a change in baseline soil fertility (as reflected by nutritional status of fresh oak litter, or soil microbial biomass and activity) nor by simple reduction of percentages of oak neighbours, nor by the presence of gymnosperms. Our results show that colonizing new niche represented by the presence of distantly related neighbours may delay plant phenology but may be supported by mycorrhizal mutualists.

The purpose of this study was to understand how phosphorus uptake relates to the phenology of R. adoneus and to ascertain whether arbusculus, fungal structures used for nutrient transfer. were present when maximum phosphorus accumulation was occurring. Arbuscules were only present for a few weeks during the growing season of R. adoneus and their presence corresponded with increased phosphorus accumulation in both the roots and shoots of R. udoneus. In addition, phosphorus accumulation and peaks in mycorrhizal development occurred well after plant reproduction and most plant growth had occurred. The late season accumulation of phosphorus by mycorrhizal roots of R. adoneus is stored for use during early season growth and flowering the following spring. In this way R. adoneus can flower before soils thaw and root or mycorrhizal nutrient uptake can occur.

J	1	AO	Panke-Buisse, K; Lee, S; Kao-Kniffin, J				Panke-Buisse, Kevin; Lee, Stacey; Kao-Kniffin, Jenny			Cultivated Sub-Populations of Soil Microbiomes Retain Early Flowering Plant Trait	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arabidopsis; Cultivation-independent; Flowering; Microbiome; Selection	ARABIDOPSIS; SELECTION; MICROORGANISMS; COMMUNITIES; GROWTH; TIME	The collection of microorganisms found in the root zone of soil, termed the rhizosphere microbiome, has been shown to impact plant growth and development. Here, we tease apart the function of the cultivable portion of the microbiome from the whole microbiome in retaining plant traits modified through artificial selection on flowering time. Specifically, the whole microbiome associated with earlier flowering time of Arabidopsis thaliana was cultivated on four types of solid media to create cultivated fractions of the microbiome. These cultivated microbiomes were subsequently preserved in glycerol, frozen, and revived to yield a portion of the cultivable fraction to compare (1) whole microbiome, (2) cultivable microbiome, and (3) revived, cultivable microbiome controls on early flowering time. Plants grown in soils inoculated with bacteria grown on 25 % Luria broth and 10 % tryptic soy agar retained the early flowering trait. An increase in leaf biomass with two of the cultivated microbiomes (49.4 and 38.5 %) contrasted the lowered biomass effect of the whole microbiome. Inoculation with the cultivated microbiomes that were cryopreserved in glycerol showed no effect on flowering time or leaf biomass. The results indicate that the cultivable portion of a plant's microbiome retains the early flowering effect in A. thaliana, but cryopreservation of the cultivated microbiomes disrupts the microbial effects on flowering time. Furthermore, the contrasting effects on leaf biomass (an indirect response from selection on early flowering time), seen with the whole microbiome versus the cultivable portion, suggests versatility in using cultivation methods to modify multiple traits of plants.

Here, we tease apart the function of the cultivable portion of the microbiome from the whole microbiome in retaining plant traits modified through artificial selection on flowering time. Specifically, the whole microbiome associated with earlier flowering time of Arabidopsis thaliana was cultivated on four types of solid media to create cultivated fractions of the microbiome. These cultivated microbiomes were subsequently preserved in glycerol, frozen, and revived to yield a portion of the cultivable fraction to compare (1) whole microbiome, (2) cultivable microbiome, and (3) revived, cultivable microbiome controls on early flowering time. Plants grown in soils inoculated with bacteria grown on 25 % Luria broth and 10 % tryptic soy agar retained the early flowering trait. An increase in leaf biomass with two of the cultivated microbiomes (49.4 and 38.5 %) contrasted the lowered biomass effect of the whole microbiome. Inoculation with the cultivated microbiomes that were cryopreserved in glycerol showed no effect on flowering time or leaf biomass.

The addition of IAA to hydroponic cultures confirmed this metabolic network.ConclusionsWe document a novel metabolic network in which soil microbiota influenced plant flowering time, thus shedding light on the key role of soil microbiota on plant functioning. This opens up multiple opportunities for application, from helping to mitigate some of the effects of climate change and environmental stress on plants (e.g. abnormal temperature variation, drought, salinity) to manipulating plant characteristics using microbial inocula to increase crop potential.

This study addresses whether seeds are passive carriers or engage a molecular dialogue with pathogens during their development. We developed two pathosystems using Medicago truncatula with Xanthomonas alfalfae subsp. alfalfae (Xaa), the natural Medicago sp. pathogen and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), a Brassicaceae pathogen. Three days after flower inoculation, the transcriptome of Xcc-infected pods showed activation of an innate immune response that was strongly limited in Xcc mutated in the type three secretion system, demonstrating an incompatible interaction of Xcc with the reproductive structures. In contrast, the presence of Xaa did not result in an activation of defence genes. Transcriptome profiling during development of infected seeds exhibited time-dependent and differential responses to Xcc and Xaa. Gene network analysis revealed that the transcriptome of Xcc-infected seeds was mainly affected during seed filling whereas that of Xaa-infected seeds responded during late maturation. The Xcc-infected seed transcriptome exhibited an activation of defence response and a repression of targeted seed maturation pathways. Fifty-one percent of putative ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 targets were deregulated by Xcc, including oleosin, cupin, legumin and chlorophyll degradation genes. At maturity, these seeds displayed decreased weight and increased chlorophyll content. In contrast, these traits were not affected by Xaa infection. These findings demonstrate the existence of a complex molecular dialogue between xanthomonads and developing seeds and provides insights into a previously unexplored trade-off between seed development and pathogen defence.

In a fully factorial experiment, young trees were grown for 3 years with or without AMF (Funneliformis mosseae and Rhizophagus irregularis), and with industrial standard fertiliser applications or restricted fertiliser (10% of standard). We use two commercial scions (Dabinett and Michelin) and rootstocks (MM111 and MM106). Industrial standard fertiliser applications reduced AMF colonisation and root biomass, potentially increasing drought sensitivity. Mycorrhizal status was influenced by above ground genotypes (scion type) but not rootstocks, indicating strong interactions between above and below ground plant tissue. The AMF inoculation significantly increased resistance to Neonectria ditissima, a globally economically significant fungal pathogen of apple orchards, but did not consistently alter leaf nutrients, growth, phenology or fruit and flower production. This study significantly advances understanding of AMF benefits to woody perennial crops, especially increased disease resistance which we show is not due to improved tree nutrition or drought alleviation.

The mechanisms behind PGPR/plant interaction are poorly understood, as most studies have described short-term responses on plants and only a few studies have analyzed plant molecular responses under PGPR colonization. Here, we studied the effects of the PGPR bacterial model Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN on the whole life cycle of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We reported that at different plant developmental points, strain PsJN can be found in the rhizosphere and also colonizing their internal tissues. In early ontogeny, strain PsJN increased several growth parameters and accelerated growth rate of the plants. Also, an Arabidopsis transcriptome analysis revealed that 408 genes showed differential expression in PsJN-inoculated plants; some of these genes are involved in stress response and hormone pathways. Specifically, genes implicated in auxin and gibberellin pathways were induced. Quantitative transcriptional analyses of selected genes in different developmental stages revealed that the beginning of these changes could be evidenced early in development, especially among the down-regulated genes. The inoculation with heat-killed bacteria provoked a more severe transcriptional response in plants, but was not able to induce plant growth-promotion. Later in ontogeny, the growth rates of inoculated plants decreased with respect to the non-inoculated group and, interestingly, the inoculation accelerated the flowering time and the appearance of senescence signs in plants; these modifications correlate with the early up-regulation of flowering control genes. Then, we show that a single inoculation with a PGPR could affect the whole life cycle of a plant, accelerating its growth rate and shortening its vegetative period, both effects relevant for most crops. Thus, these findings provide novel and interesting aspects of these relevant biological interactions.

We have investigated the interaction between P. chlamydosporia and the model system Arabidopsis thaliana under laboratory conditions in the absence of nematodes. This study demonstrates that P. chlamydosporia colonizes A. thaliana. Root colonization monitored with green fluorescent protein-tagged P. chlamydosporia and quantitative PCR (qPCR) quantitation methods revealed root cell invasion. Fungal inoculation reduced flowering time and stimulated plant growth, as determined by total FW increase, faster development of inflorescences and siliques, and a higher yield in terms of seed production per plant. Precocious flowering was associated with significant expression changes in key floweringtime genes. In addition, we also provided molecular and genetic evidence that point towards jasmonate signaling as an important factor to modulate progression of plant colonization by the fungus. Our results indicate that P. chlamydosporia provides benefits to the plant in addition to its nematophagous activity. This report highlights the potential of P. chlamydosporia to improve yield in economically important crops.

'Queen Fabiola' was grown with or without arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) inoculum in pasteurized or nonpasteurized soil to determine if inoculation altered flower and corm production. The first growing cycle after planting, mycorrhizal inoculation decreased the days to anthesis and increased the number of flowers produced per inflorescence and flower longevity. It also affected the quality of the daughter corm, which influenced flowering the following year. Inoculated plants produced larger daughter corms and more cormels than uninoculated plants, and allocated more biomass to the corms than the cormels, which lowered the average weight of the cormels. Corms produced by inoculated plants also had higher concentration of nitrogen, potassium, zinc, and nonreducing sugars than those produced by uninoculated plants. The beneficial effects of AMF inoculation on flowering and corm/cormel production were generally increased by soil pasteurization. The results indicate that mycorrhizal inoculation may enhance commercial cut flower and corm production of this crop.

The soil microbial community alters patterns of selection on flowering time and fitness-related traits in Ipomoea purpurea	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						agent of selection; common morning glory; Convolvulaceae; correlated selection; microbiome; phenology; phenotypic change; plant growth; selection differentials; selection gradients	PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; PLANT; PHENOLOGY; PLASTICITY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; RESPONSES; DRIVERS; ECOLOGY; COSTS	Premise Plant flowering time plays an important role in plant fitness and thus evolutionary processes. Soil microbial communities are diverse and have a large impact, both positive and negative, on the host plant. However, owing to few available studies, how the soil microbial community may influence the evolutionary response of plant populations is not well understood. Here we sought to uncover whether belowground microbial communities act as an agent of selection on flowering and growth traits in the common morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea. Methods We performed a controlled greenhouse experiment in which genetic lines of I. purpurea were planted into either sterilized soils or in soils that were sterilized and inoculated with the microbial community from original field soil. We could thus directly test the influence of alterations to the microbial community on plant growth, flowering, and fitness and assess patterns of selection in both soil microbial environments. Results A more complex soil microbial community resulted in larger plants that produced more flowers. Selection strongly favored earlier flowering when plants were grown in the complex microbial environment than compared to sterilized soil. We also uncovered a pattern of negative correlational selection on growth rate and flowering time, indicating that selection favored different combinations of growth and flowering traits in the simplified versus complex soil community. Conclusions Together, these results suggest the soil microbial community is a selective agent on flowering time and ultimately that soil microbial community influences important plant evolutionary processes.

The aims of this study were to identify the fungal community (endophytic and non-endophytic) associated with C. oblongifolia seeds and to test the effects of these different fungal species on germination. In general, germination of C. oblongifolia seeds was high (about 85 %), initiating four days after sowing and continuing for a total of 20 days. External asepsis with sodium hypochlorite did not influence germinability of C. oblongifolia. Seed infestation with Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, Mucor sp. and Rhizopus stolonifer did not affect the time required for germination, however, infection with A. flavus negatively affected germination percentage. Endophytic fungi were not isolated from C. oblongifolia seeds, suggesting that this species does not transmit endophytic fungi vertically. Therefore, C. oblongifolia can be classified in Class 3 with regard to the transmission and presence of endophytes.

The aims of this study were to identify the fungal community (endophytic and non-endophytic) associated with C. oblongifolia seeds and to test the effects of these different fungal species on germination. In general, germination of C. oblongifolia seeds was high (about 85 %), initiating four days after sowing and continuing for a total of 20 days. External asepsis with sodium hypochlorite did not influence germinability of C. oblongifolia. Seed infestation with Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, Mucor sp. and Rhizopus stolonifer did not affect the time required for germination, however, infection with A. flavus negatively affected germination percentage. Endophytic fungi were not isolated from C. oblongifolia seeds, suggesting that this species does not transmit endophytic fungi vertically. Therefore, C. oblongifolia can be classified in Class 3 with regard to the transmission and presence of endophytes.

This study investigated seed germination of Crataegus pseudoheterophylla Pojark using different combinations of growth promoting rhizobacteria and stratification regimes. The PGPR treatments were Azotobacter chroococcum 12, Azospirillum lipoferum OF, Pseudomonas fluorescens 169, Bacillus subtilis FzB24 and combinations (co-inoculation) using two or all PGPR inoculants. The control was no inoculation followed by stratification. Temperature regulation in the stratification regime was 1 month at the constant temperature of 23 C, then 3 months at 4 degrees C. The alternate temperature regime was 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C followed by 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C, then 1 month at 4 degrees C. The effects of these treatments were evaluated and results showed that treatments of PGPR inoculation stimulated germination in terms of percentage of seed germination, speed of germination and mean germination time, and effect was significant at (p <0.05). Higher percentages of seed germination (18.33%) and speed of germination (4.82 number/day) were recorded for co-inoculated seeds by the combination of all bacterial inoculants and the alternate temperature stratification regime. Results showed a higher percentage of seed germination using alternate temperature stratification than for the constant temperature stratification regime.

The alternate temperature regime was 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C followed by 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C, then 1 month at 4 degrees C. The effects of these treatments were evaluated and results showed that treatments of PGPR inoculation stimulated germination in terms of percentage of seed germination, speed of germination and mean germination time, and effect was significant at (p <0.05). Higher percentages of seed germination (18.33%) and speed of germination (4.82 number/day) were recorded for co-inoculated seeds by the combination of all bacterial inoculants and the alternate temperature stratification regime. Results showed a higher percentage of seed germination using alternate temperature stratification than for the constant temperature stratification regime. These results suggest that PGPRs in combination were effective in terms of promoting germination of C pseudoheterophylla seeds. (C) 0 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The PGPR treatments were Azotobacter chroococcum 12, Azospirillum lipoferum OF, Pseudomonas fluorescens 169, Bacillus subtilis FzB24 and combinations (co-inoculation) using two or all PGPR inoculants. The control was no inoculation followed by stratification. Temperature regulation in the stratification regime was 1 month at the constant temperature of 23 C, then 3 months at 4 degrees C. The alternate temperature regime was 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C followed by 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C, then 1 month at 4 degrees C. The effects of these treatments were evaluated and results showed that treatments of PGPR inoculation stimulated germination in terms of percentage of seed germination, speed of germination and mean germination time, and effect was significant at (p <0.05). Higher percentages of seed germination (18.33%) and speed of germination (4.82 number/day) were recorded for co-inoculated seeds by the combination of all bacterial inoculants and the alternate temperature stratification regime. Results showed a higher percentage of seed germination using alternate temperature stratification than for the constant temperature stratification regime. These results suggest that PGPRs in combination were effective in terms of promoting germination of C pseudoheterophylla seeds. (C) 0 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study investigated seed germination of Crataegus pseudoheterophylla Pojark using different combinations of growth promoting rhizobacteria and stratification regimes. The PGPR treatments were Azotobacter chroococcum 12, Azospirillum lipoferum OF, Pseudomonas fluorescens 169, Bacillus subtilis FzB24 and combinations (co-inoculation) using two or all PGPR inoculants. The control was no inoculation followed by stratification. Temperature regulation in the stratification regime was 1 month at the constant temperature of 23 C, then 3 months at 4 degrees C. The alternate temperature regime was 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C followed by 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C, then 1 month at 4 degrees C. The effects of these treatments were evaluated and results showed that treatments of PGPR inoculation stimulated germination in terms of percentage of seed germination, speed of germination and mean germination time, and effect was significant at (p <0.05). Higher percentages of seed germination (18.33%) and speed of germination (4.82 number/day) were recorded for co-inoculated seeds by the combination of all bacterial inoculants and the alternate temperature stratification regime. Results showed a higher percentage of seed germination using alternate temperature stratification than for the constant temperature stratification regime. These results suggest that PGPRs in combination were effective in terms of promoting germination of C pseudoheterophylla seeds. (C) 0 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Given the economic importance of these crops and pressures faced by growers to produce plants of high aesthetic quality, we surveyed the natural occurrence of foliar fungal endophytes in Knock Out (R) roses to identify candidate beneficial isolates. We also tested the effects of entomopathogenic fungal inocula on marigold and zinnia plant growth using different application approaches. Our survey of Knock Out (R) rose foliage collected from five sites within central Texas revealed at least 24 different fungal genera and 30 probable species, including some isolates providing plant stress tolerance and pathogens or antagonists of insects and nematode pests. The effects of entomopathogen inocula on plant growth varied with host plant (marigold vs. zinnia) and inoculation method (soil drench vs. seed soak). Plant responses were complex, but inoculation with Isaria fumosorosea Wize tended to have a negative effect on plant performance characteristics whereas Beauveria bassiana (Bals.-Criv.) Vuill. tended to have positive effects. When applied to marigold as a seedcoating, I. fumosorosea reduced germination, seedling fresh weight, and produced seedlings with a less compact form. By contrast, seeds inoculated with B. bassiana required less time to germinate, had higher germination rates, and increased the plant compactness. These results show that the impact of fungal entomopathogens applied as endophytes depends on the specific fungi-plant combination being examined. The effect of plant inoculation with entomopathogenic fungi within a pest management context requires further evaluation.

Common bean and cowpea seeds were treated with crude water and acetone extracts of Agapanthus caulescens Spreng., Allium sativum L., Carica papaya L. and Syzygium cordatum Hochst. ex Krauss at 5 and 15 mg/ml concentrations. Seeds treated with the synthetic fungicide fludioxonil+ mefenoxam (the commercial product Celest (R) XL) represented the positive control, whereas dimethyl sulphoxide and water-soaked seeds represented negative controls. The rolled paper towel method of the International Seed Testing Association was used to investigate the effect of the treatments on seed germination. Mean emergence time (MET) was determined using seed inoculated with the respective pathogens. The changes in the ultrastructure of embryonic roots and the connecting tissues of embryo-cotyledon of common bean and cowpea treated with Syzygium acetone extracts and Agapanthus water extracts were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High germination percentages of > 90% were observed in bean seeds from two production seasons treated with low concentrations of water extracts of Allium, Syzygium and Agapanthus and acetone extracts of Allium, Agapanthus and Carica. These treatments also recorded high emergence percentages with low MET values, which were similar to the water control. Cowpea seeds treated with Carica water extract had the highest germination and emergence. Syzygium acetone was the only extract that gave higher germination and emergence in both IT93K5132 and PAN 311 varieties. Therefore, Carica water and Syzygium acetone extracts can be considered as potential bean and cowpea seed treatments. Generally, there were inconsistencies in terms of correlations of germination with emergence percentages in both cowpea and bean seed treated with plant extracts used in the study, which could be due to differences in vigour. The TEM study of embryo-cotyledon tissue of both species revealed that Syzygium and Agapanthus extract seed treatment may accelerate metabolic processes as evidenced by the presence of vacuoles, many cristae and few lipid bodies.

Germination and seedling emergence responses of common bean and cowpea to plant extract seed treatments	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY; IN-VITRO; PATHOGENS; PEA; ULTRASTRUCTURE; AGRICULTURE; COTYLEDONS; IMBIBITION; FUNGICIDES; DISEASE	The present study was initiated to investigate the effect of crude plant extracts as seed treatments on Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) and Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) seed germination and emergence in the presence of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum and Colletotrichum dematium, respectively. Common bean and cowpea seeds were treated with crude water and acetone extracts of Agapanthus caulescens Spreng., Allium sativum L., Carica papaya L. and Syzygium cordatum Hochst. ex Krauss at 5 and 15 mg/ml concentrations. Seeds treated with the synthetic fungicide fludioxonil+ mefenoxam (the commercial product Celest (R) XL) represented the positive control, whereas dimethyl sulphoxide and water-soaked seeds represented negative controls. The rolled paper towel method of the International Seed Testing Association was used to investigate the effect of the treatments on seed germination. Mean emergence time (MET) was determined using seed inoculated with the respective pathogens. The changes in the ultrastructure of embryonic roots and the connecting tissues of embryo-cotyledon of common bean and cowpea treated with Syzygium acetone extracts and Agapanthus water extracts were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High germination percentages of > 90% were observed in bean seeds from two production seasons treated with low concentrations of water extracts of Allium, Syzygium and Agapanthus and acetone extracts of Allium, Agapanthus and Carica. These treatments also recorded high emergence percentages with low MET values, which were similar to the water control. Cowpea seeds treated with Carica water extract had the highest germination and emergence. Syzygium acetone was the only extract that gave higher germination and emergence in both IT93K5132 and PAN 311 varieties. Therefore, Carica water and Syzygium acetone extracts can be considered as potential bean and cowpea seed treatments. Generally, there were inconsistencies in terms of correlations of germination with emergence percentages in both cowpea and bean seed treated with plant extracts used in the study, which could be due to differences in vigour. The TEM study of embryo-cotyledon tissue of both species revealed that Syzygium and Agapanthus extract seed treatment may accelerate metabolic processes as evidenced by the presence of vacuoles, many cristae and few lipid bodies.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are promising candidates but the phenotypic changes induced by PGPR under drought remain to be elucidated. We investigated the effects of Phyllobacterium brassicacearum STM196 strain, a PGPR isolated from the rhizosphere of oilseed rape, on two accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana with contrasting flowering time. We measured multiple morphophysiological traits related to plant growth and development in order to quantify the added value of the bacteria to drought-response strategies of Arabidopsis in soil conditions. A delay in reproductive development induced by the bacteria resulted in a gain of biomass that was independent of the accession and the watering regime. Coordinated changes in transpiration, ABA content, photosynthesis and development resulted in higher water-use efficiency and a better tolerance to drought of inoculated plants. Our findings give new insights into the ecophysiological bases by which PGPR can confer stress tolerance to plants.

Here, we conducted a pot experiment to test whether life cycle and flowering phenology traits of host plant Medicago truncatula Gaertn can be altered by AMF under low and high soil phosphorus (P) levels. Methods The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at Zhejiang University in China (120 degrees 19'E, 30 degrees 26'N) and had a completely randomized design with two factors: AMF treatments and soil P levels. Six AMF species (Acaulospora scrobiculata, As; Gigaspora margarita, Gma; Funneliformis geosporum, Fg; Rhizophagus intraradices, Ri; Funneliformis mosseae, Fmo and Glomus tortuosum, Gt.) were used, and two soil P levels (24.0 and 5.7 mg kg(-1) Olsen-soluble P) were designed. The six AMF species were separately inoculated or in a mixture (Mix), and a non-AMF control (NAMF) was included. When plants began to flower, the number of flowers in each pot was recorded daily. During fruit ripening, the number of mature fruits was also recorded daily. After similar to 4 months, the biomass, biomass P content and AMF colonization of host plant were measured. Correlation between root colonization and first flowering time, or P content and first flowering time was analyzed. Important Findings Under the low P level, first flowering time negatively correlated with root colonization and biomass P. Only host plants with AMF species As, Fg, Ri, or Mix were able to complete their life cycle within 112 days after sowing. And treatment with AMF species Fg, Gt, or As resulted in two periods of rapid flower production while other fungi treatments resulted in only one within 112 days after sowing. The cumulative number of flowers produced and biomass P content were highest with species Fg. Host biomass allocation significantly differed depending on the species of AMF. Under both soil P levels, the host plant tended to allocate more biomass to fruits in the Mix treatment than in the other treatments. These results indicated that the effects of AMF on host flowering phenology and biomass allocation differed depending on AMF species and soil P levels.

Here, we conducted a pot experiment to test whether life cycle and flowering phenology traits of host plant Medicago truncatula Gaertn can be altered by AMF under low and high soil phosphorus (P) levels. Methods The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at Zhejiang University in China (120 degrees 19'E, 30 degrees 26'N) and had a completely randomized design with two factors: AMF treatments and soil P levels. Six AMF species (Acaulospora scrobiculata, As; Gigaspora margarita, Gma; Funneliformis geosporum, Fg; Rhizophagus intraradices, Ri; Funneliformis mosseae, Fmo and Glomus tortuosum, Gt.) were used, and two soil P levels (24.0 and 5.7 mg kg(-1) Olsen-soluble P) were designed. The six AMF species were separately inoculated or in a mixture (Mix), and a non-AMF control (NAMF) was included. When plants began to flower, the number of flowers in each pot was recorded daily. During fruit ripening, the number of mature fruits was also recorded daily. After similar to 4 months, the biomass, biomass P content and AMF colonization of host plant were measured. Correlation between root colonization and first flowering time, or P content and first flowering time was analyzed. Important Findings Under the low P level, first flowering time negatively correlated with root colonization and biomass P. Only host plants with AMF species As, Fg, Ri, or Mix were able to complete their life cycle within 112 days after sowing. And treatment with AMF species Fg, Gt, or As resulted in two periods of rapid flower production while other fungi treatments resulted in only one within 112 days after sowing. The cumulative number of flowers produced and biomass P content were highest with species Fg. Host biomass allocation significantly differed depending on the species of AMF. Under both soil P levels, the host plant tended to allocate more biomass to fruits in the Mix treatment than in the other treatments. These results indicated that the effects of AMF on host flowering phenology and biomass allocation differed depending on AMF species and soil P levels.

The six AMF species were separately inoculated or in a mixture (Mix), and a non-AMF control (NAMF) was included. When plants began to flower, the number of flowers in each pot was recorded daily. During fruit ripening, the number of mature fruits was also recorded daily. After similar to 4 months, the biomass, biomass P content and AMF colonization of host plant were measured. Correlation between root colonization and first flowering time, or P content and first flowering time was analyzed. Important Findings Under the low P level, first flowering time negatively correlated with root colonization and biomass P. Only host plants with AMF species As, Fg, Ri, or Mix were able to complete their life cycle within 112 days after sowing. And treatment with AMF species Fg, Gt, or As resulted in two periods of rapid flower production while other fungi treatments resulted in only one within 112 days after sowing. The cumulative number of flowers produced and biomass P content were highest with species Fg. Host biomass allocation significantly differed depending on the species of AMF. Under both soil P levels, the host plant tended to allocate more biomass to fruits in the Mix treatment than in the other treatments. These results indicated that the effects of AMF on host flowering phenology and biomass allocation differed depending on AMF species and soil P levels.

Here, we conducted a pot experiment to test whether life cycle and flowering phenology traits of host plant Medicago truncatula Gaertn can be altered by AMF under low and high soil phosphorus (P) levels. Methods The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at Zhejiang University in China (120 degrees 19'E, 30 degrees 26'N) and had a completely randomized design with two factors: AMF treatments and soil P levels. Six AMF species (Acaulospora scrobiculata, As; Gigaspora margarita, Gma; Funneliformis geosporum, Fg; Rhizophagus intraradices, Ri; Funneliformis mosseae, Fmo and Glomus tortuosum, Gt.) were used, and two soil P levels (24.0 and 5.7 mg kg(-1) Olsen-soluble P) were designed. The six AMF species were separately inoculated or in a mixture (Mix), and a non-AMF control (NAMF) was included. When plants began to flower, the number of flowers in each pot was recorded daily. During fruit ripening, the number of mature fruits was also recorded daily. After similar to 4 months, the biomass, biomass P content and AMF colonization of host plant were measured. Correlation between root colonization and first flowering time, or P content and first flowering time was analyzed. Important Findings Under the low P level, first flowering time negatively correlated with root colonization and biomass P. Only host plants with AMF species As, Fg, Ri, or Mix were able to complete their life cycle within 112 days after sowing. And treatment with AMF species Fg, Gt, or As resulted in two periods of rapid flower production while other fungi treatments resulted in only one within 112 days after sowing. The cumulative number of flowers produced and biomass P content were highest with species Fg. Host biomass allocation significantly differed depending on the species of AMF. Under both soil P levels, the host plant tended to allocate more biomass to fruits in the Mix treatment than in the other treatments. These results indicated that the effects of AMF on host flowering phenology and biomass allocation differed depending on AMF species and soil P levels.

Here, we conducted a pot experiment to test whether life cycle and flowering phenology traits of host plant Medicago truncatula Gaertn can be altered by AMF under low and high soil phosphorus (P) levels. Methods The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at Zhejiang University in China (120 degrees 19'E, 30 degrees 26'N) and had a completely randomized design with two factors: AMF treatments and soil P levels. Six AMF species (Acaulospora scrobiculata, As; Gigaspora margarita, Gma; Funneliformis geosporum, Fg; Rhizophagus intraradices, Ri; Funneliformis mosseae, Fmo and Glomus tortuosum, Gt.) were used, and two soil P levels (24.0 and 5.7 mg kg(-1) Olsen-soluble P) were designed. The six AMF species were separately inoculated or in a mixture (Mix), and a non-AMF control (NAMF) was included. When plants began to flower, the number of flowers in each pot was recorded daily. During fruit ripening, the number of mature fruits was also recorded daily. After similar to 4 months, the biomass, biomass P content and AMF colonization of host plant were measured. Correlation between root colonization and first flowering time, or P content and first flowering time was analyzed. Important Findings Under the low P level, first flowering time negatively correlated with root colonization and biomass P. Only host plants with AMF species As, Fg, Ri, or Mix were able to complete their life cycle within 112 days after sowing. And treatment with AMF species Fg, Gt, or As resulted in two periods of rapid flower production while other fungi treatments resulted in only one within 112 days after sowing. The cumulative number of flowers produced and biomass P content were highest with species Fg. Host biomass allocation significantly differed depending on the species of AMF.

Six AMF species (Acaulospora scrobiculata, As; Gigaspora margarita, Gma; Funneliformis geosporum, Fg; Rhizophagus intraradices, Ri; Funneliformis mosseae, Fmo and Glomus tortuosum, Gt.) were used, and two soil P levels (24.0 and 5.7 mg kg(-1) Olsen-soluble P) were designed. The six AMF species were separately inoculated or in a mixture (Mix), and a non-AMF control (NAMF) was included. When plants began to flower, the number of flowers in each pot was recorded daily. During fruit ripening, the number of mature fruits was also recorded daily. After similar to 4 months, the biomass, biomass P content and AMF colonization of host plant were measured. Correlation between root colonization and first flowering time, or P content and first flowering time was analyzed. Important Findings Under the low P level, first flowering time negatively correlated with root colonization and biomass P. Only host plants with AMF species As, Fg, Ri, or Mix were able to complete their life cycle within 112 days after sowing. And treatment with AMF species Fg, Gt, or As resulted in two periods of rapid flower production while other fungi treatments resulted in only one within 112 days after sowing. The cumulative number of flowers produced and biomass P content were highest with species Fg. Host biomass allocation significantly differed depending on the species of AMF. Under both soil P levels, the host plant tended to allocate more biomass to fruits in the Mix treatment than in the other treatments. These results indicated that the effects of AMF on host flowering phenology and biomass allocation differed depending on AMF species and soil P levels.

Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Association in Genetically Modified Drought-Tolerant Corn	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							PLANTS; SOIL; COLONIZATION; STRESS; PHOSPHORUS; SYMBIOSIS; PATHWAYS; ETHYLENE; IMPACT; ROOTS	The commercial use of genetically modified (GM) plants has significantly increased worldwide. The interactions between GM plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are of considerable importance given the agricultural and ecological role of AM and the lack of knowledge regarding potential effects of drought-tolerant GM corn (Zea mays L.) on AM fungal symbiosis. This work studied AM fungal colonization in five corn lines growing under two different irrigation regimes (30 and 100% of soil field capacity [SFC]). Four of the lines were GM corn, and two of these were drought tolerant. The experiment was conducted for 60 d in a growth chamber under constant irrigation, after which mycorrhization, corn biomass, and days to plant senescence (DTS) were evaluated. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species of the order Diversisporales were predominant in the soil inocula. At the end of the experiment, all plants showed AM colonization. Mycorrhization was higher at 30% SFC than at 100% SFC. Within the same corn line, the AM fungi produced more vesicles in plant roots under drought stress. Among treatments, DTS varied significantly, and drought-tolerant GM corn lines survived longer than the wild-type corn when maintained at 100% SFC. Corn biomass did not vary among treatments, and no correlations were found between DTS or biomass and mycorrhization. We conclude that overexpression of the Hahb-4 gene in corn plants under the experimental conditions of this study did not affect AM fungal infectivity and improved the tolerance of the corn to drought stress.

Baekgwang in response to the different timing of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation were examined. To evaluate the effects of AMF inoculation timing on growth of chrysanthemum cuttings, AMF was directly inoculated to cutting (AMFD), or inoculated at transplanting stage (AMFA). Control plants did not receive AMF inoculation (CON). A significant difference in plant growth was observed in AMF treatment compared to noninoculated treatment at transplanting stage. Rooting rate in AMF treatment was 99% whereas it was 76% in non-mycorrhizal inoculation. The colonization rate was 3.9% in AMF treatment, while it was 0% in non-AMF treatment. Tap root length and number of lateral roots in AMF treatment were twice than those of non-AMF treatment. Inoculation of AMF significantly increased shoot and root growth at transplanting stage. At 7 weeks after transplanting, chrysanthemum plants in AMFD and AMFA treatments had 46.42 and 34.24% colonization rate, respectively. Low colonization rate (6.08%) was observed in CON, possibly due to contamination. Plant height, leaf area, root length, and fresh and dry weight of shoots, stems and,roots in AMF inoculation treatments (AMFD and AMFA) were significantly higher than control plants. AMF-inoculation significantly shortened flowering time compared to non-AMF plants. Chrysanthemum in AMID, AMFA and CON-treatments flowered at 98, 104 and 112 days after transplanting, respectively. Fresh weight, width and height of flowers in AMFD and AMFA treatments were generally higher than those in CON. However, a significant increase in fresh weight, width and height of flowers was found in AMFD treatment. A significant increase of macronutrient uptake in leaves was observed for AMFD treatment, compared with CON. Mn uptake in AMFD and AMFA was more than double than that in CON. In roots, macro and micronutrient concentrations were generally higher in AMFD. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

From plant fungi to bee parasites: mycorrhizae and soil nutrients shape floral chemistry and bee pathogens	ECOLOGY			English	Article						alkaloid; bee decline; bee parasites; Bombus impatiens; Crithidia; floral chemistry; multitrophic effects; mycorrhizae; soil; trypanosome	DISEASE; POLLINATORS; LIMITATION; INCREASE; IMPACTS; REWARDS; DEFENSE; REVEAL	Bee populations have experienced declines in recent years, due in part to increased disease incidence. Multiple factors influence bee-pathogen interactions, including nectar and pollen quality and secondary metabolites. However, we lack an understanding of how plant interactions with their environment shape bee diet quality. We examined how plant interactions with the belowground environment alter floral rewards and, in turn, bee-pathogen interactions. Soil-dwelling mycorrhizal fungi are considered plant mutualists, although the outcome of the relationship depends on environmental conditions such as nutrients. In a 2 x 2 factorial design, we asked whether mycorrhizal fungi and nutrients affect concentrations of nectar and pollen alkaloids (anabasine and nicotine) previously shown to reduce infection by the gut pathogen Crithidia in the native bumble bee Bombus impatiens. To ask how plant interactions affect this common bee pathogen, we fed pollen and nectar from our treatment plants, and from a wildflower pollen control with artificial nectar, to bees infected with Crithidia. Mycorrhizal fungi and fertilizer both influenced flowering phenology and floral chemistry. While we found no anabasine or nicotine in nectar, high fertilizer increased anabasine and nicotine in pollen. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) decreased nicotine concentrations, but the reduction due to AMF was stronger in high than low-nutrient conditions. AMF and nutrients also had interactive effects on bee pathogens via changes in nectar and pollen. High fertilizer reduced Crithidia cell counts relative to low fertilizer in AMF plants, but increased Crithidia in non-AMF plants. These results did not correspond with effects of fertilizer and AMF on pollen alkaloid concentrations, suggesting that other components of pollen or nectar were affected by treatments and shaped pathogen counts. Our results indicate that soil biotic and abiotic environment can alter bee-pathogen interactions via changes in floral rewards, and underscore the importance of integrative studies to predict disease dynamics and ecological outcomes.

These were termed trifoliates and multifoliates, respectively. The trifoliates did not increase in size or undergo visible signs of development including flowering or senescence. The multifoliates increased in height by 4 to 5 times, flowered, set seed and senesced. Both plantlet types were nodulated by four strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The timing of nodulation and the nodule phenotype were indistinguishable from those observed when seed-grown plants were nodulated by the same strains. As in seed-grown plants, nitrogen fixation in multifoliates declined just prior to flowering. Since the same decline was observed in non-flowering trifoliates, it is unlikely that flowering and seed set, alone, are responsible for the observed decline in nitrogen fixation.

The Influence of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi on Plant Reproduction	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Pollinators; Floral display; VOCs; Pollen germination; Pollen tube growth	SOIL-PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; BELOW-GROUND MUTUALISM; VEGETATIVE GROWTH; FRUIT PRODUCTION; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; INOCULATION; INFECTION; COLONIZATION; FLAVONOIDS; L.	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can influence all components of plant reproduction including pollen delivery, pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fertilization, and seed germination. AM fungi associate with plant roots, uptake nutrients, and prime plants for faster defense responses. Our literature review first identified four testable hypotheses describing how AM fungi could alter pollen delivery: (1) We hypothesize AM fungi promote floral display size. The influence of AM fungi on flower size and number is supported by literature, however there are no studies on floral color. (2) We hypothesize AM fungi promote pollen and nectar quality and quantity, and, as reported before, AM fungi promote male fitness over female fitness. (3) We hypothesize AM fungi promote both earlier and longer flowering times, but we found no consistent trend in the data for earlier or later or longer flowering times. (4) We hypothesize AM fungi alter floral secondary chemistry and VOCs, and find there is clear evidence for the alteration of floral chemistry but little data on VOCs. Second, we focus on how AM fungi could alter pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fertilization, and present three testable hypotheses. We found evidence that AM fungi influence pollen germination and pollen tube growth, production of seeds, and seed germination. However, while most of these influences are positive they are not conclusive, because studies have been conducted in small numbers of systems and groups. Therefore, we conclude that the majority of research to date may not be measuring the influence of AM fungi on the most important components of plant reproduction: pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fertilization, and seed germination.
