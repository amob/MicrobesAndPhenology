First generation (maternal) plants were grown either with or without mycorrhizal inoculation with Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith. We collected early and late cohorts of seeds which were used to produce second generation (offspring) plants. Offspring plants were grown either with or without mycorrhizal inoculation with G. intraradices. Irrespective of maternal mycorrhizal status, we found that offspring of early cohort seeds had greater percent mycorrhizal colonization early in the growing season, a greater proportion of plants flowering early in the season, and a greater number of capsules per plant at the end of the season compared with offspring of late cohort seeds. These differences were observed despite the fact that shoot N and P concentrations were greater in offspring of late cohort seeds. We found that mycorrhizal colonization of maternal plants decreased the average time to reproductive maturity in offspring plants, but did not significantly influence any other vegetative or reproductive trait in the offspring plants. Mycorrhizal colonization of offspring plants resulted in a greater number of branches per plant and a greater number of mature capsules per branch. Mycorrhizal colonization of offspring plants also resulted in a significant increase in seed P content, but only for seeds that were produced late in the growing season. We conclude that mycorrhizal colonization of the offspring generation was more important than mycorrhizal colonization of the maternal generation in determining offspring reproductive output, but maternal seed cohort is an important interacting factor that influences offspring fecundity.

Certain bacteria could augment the trap crop stimulatory effect. We studied the effect of three bacteria introduced to the rhizosphere of three cowpea varieties at planting. Number of days to cowpea flowering was noted and at harvest, data were collected on pod characteristics and biomass. Means of data subjected to ANOVA were compared using Tukey's Studentized Range Test. We analysed bacterial headspace volatiles for ethylene by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Bacterial type significantly influenced the cowpea varieties with better performance over the non-inoculated control. Average pod weight (g) with bacterial treatment was 37.97 for Enterobacter sakazakii 8MR5, 34.38 for Pseudomonas 44MS8 and 27.46 for Pseudomonas 10M3. Non-inoculated control had an average weight of 20.98 g. Bacteria promoted a significant increase in pod weight (>= 30.89%), fresh biomass (>= 24.22%), and improved pod number (>= 20.54%) and pod wall thickness (>= 7.33%) with no deleterious effect on plant health. Ethylene released by the bacteria ranged from trace concentrations in Pseudomonas sp. to 210 nmoles/10(8) c. f. u./ml in Ent. sakazakii 8MR5.

FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis; Medicago truncatula (barrel medic); in vitro plant culture; life-history strategy; defoliation	PLANT-GROWTH; SCUTELLOSPORA-RETICULATA; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; GIGASPORA-MARGARITA; MEDICAGO-TRUNCATULA; MONOXENIC CULTURE; SPORE PRODUCTION; ROOTS; COLONIZATION; MYCELIUM	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi obligatorily depend on carbon (C) resources provided via the plant and therefore fluctuations in C availability may strongly and differently affect AM fungi with different life-history strategies (LHS). In the present study, we examined the effect of repeated defoliation of in vitro grown barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) on the spore and auxiliary cell (AC) production dynamics of a presumed r-strategist (Glomus intraradices) and a presumed K-strategist (Dentiscutata reticulata). Glomus intraradices modulated the production of spores directly to C availability, showing direct investment in reproduction as expected for r-strategists. In contrast, AC production of D. reticulata was not affected after a single defoliation and thus showed higher resistance to fluctuating C levels, as expected for K-strategists. Our results demonstrate that plant defoliation affects the production of extraradical C storage structures of G. intraradices and D. reticulata differently. Our results contribute towards revealing differences in LHS among AM fungal species, a step further towards understanding their community dynamics in natural ecosystems and agroenvironments.

Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN induces long-term metabolic and transcriptional changes involved in Arabidopsis thaliana salt tolerance	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR); ion transport; osmotic stress response; priming; abiotic stress tolerance; reactive oxygen species (ROS); rhizosphere; beneficial bacteria	GROWTH-PROMOTING RHIZOBACTERIUM; ABIOTIC STRESS TOLERANCE; VITIS-VINIFERA L.; PLANT-GROWTH; OXIDATIVE STRESS; NA+ TRANSPORT; ACC DEAMINASE; SALINITY; GENE; EXPRESSION	Salinity is one of the major limitations for food production worldwide. Improvement of plant salt-stress tolerance using plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) has arisen as a promising strategy to help overcome this limitation. However, the molecular and biochemical mechanisms controlling PGPR/plant interactions under salt-stress remain unclear. The main objective of this study was to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying salt-stress tolerance enhancement in the salt-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants, when inoculated with the well-known PGPR strain Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN. To tackle this, different life history traits, together with the spatiotemporal accumulation patterns for key metabolites and salt-stress related transcripts, were analyzed in inoculated plants under short and long-term salt-stress. Inoculated plants displayed faster recovery and increased tolerance after sustained salt-stress. PsJN treatment accelerated the accumulation of proline and transcription of genes related to abscisic acid signaling (Relative to Dessication, RD29A and RD29B), ROS scavenging Oscorbate Peroxidase 2), and detoxification (Glyoxalase I 7), and down-regulated the expression of Lipoxygenase 2 (related to jasmonic acid biosynthesis). Among the general transcriptional effects of this bacterium, the expression pattern of important ion-homeostasis related genes was altered after short and longterm stress (Arabidopsis K Transporter 1, High-Affinity K Transporter 1, Sodium Hydrogen Exchanger 2, and Arabidopsis Salt Overly Sensitive 1). In all, the faster and stronger molecular changes induced by the inoculation suggest a PsJN-priming effect, which may explain the observed tolerance after short-term and sustained salt-stress in plants. This study provides novel information about possible mechanisms involved in salt-stress tolerance induced by PGPR in plants, showing that certain changes are maintained over time. This opens up new venues to study these relevant biological associations, as well as new approaches to a better understanding of the spatiotemporal mechanisms involved in stress tolerance in plants.

ICPh phytoplasma infection of different A. thaliana ecotypes resulted in a wide range of symptom patterns. Ecotype Col-0 was selected for the repeatable time course and the severity of flower developmental alterations. By inoculating Col-0 at 30 days after germination with ICPh phytoplasma in short day, flowers were produced with increasingly severe symptoms, from carpels modification to virescence, phyllody, loss of determinacy and loss of organ developmental pattern. Gene expression analysis showed strong down regulation of some homeotic genes involved in flowering and genes involved in the gibberellin metabolism. Common morphological features were detected in phyto-plasma-infected wild type plants and healthy mutants impaired in the gene functions that were found to be down-regulated in the infected plants. Evidence from the analysis of morphological alterations and from the results of quantitative real time PCR pointed to a central role of the deregulation of SEPALLATA genes, that are involved in flower development and hormonal control.

To examine the potential importance of phyllosphere microbes on non-disease related plant traits, we used sterile Arabidopsis clones to test the effects of foliar fungi on flowering phenology and reproductive allocation under conditions of varying water stress. We inoculated the sterile plants with fully-factorial combinations of four fungal isolates, then measured flowering time and reproductive allocation for each treatment group under normal and water-stressed conditions. All plants inoculated with foliar fungi had significantly later flowering and greater seed mass than the sterile control groups. The magnitude of this effect depended on the specific fungi present, but individual fungal effects diminished as inoculum richness increased. Above-ground microbes likely influence other plant traits as well and should be considered in any study measuring plant phenotypes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are promising candidates but the phenotypic changes induced by PGPR under drought remain to be elucidated. We investigated the effects of Phyllobacterium brassicacearum STM196 strain, a PGPR isolated from the rhizosphere of oilseed rape, on two accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana with contrasting flowering time. We measured multiple morphophysiological traits related to plant growth and development in order to quantify the added value of the bacteria to drought-response strategies of Arabidopsis in soil conditions. A delay in reproductive development induced by the bacteria resulted in a gain of biomass that was independent of the accession and the watering regime. Coordinated changes in transpiration, ABA content, photosynthesis and development resulted in higher water-use efficiency and a better tolerance to drought of inoculated plants. Our findings give new insights into the ecophysiological bases by which PGPR can confer stress tolerance to plants. Rhizobacteria-induced delay in flowering time could represent a valuable strategy for increasing biomass yield, whereas rhizobacteria-induced improvement of water use is of particular interest in multiple scenarios of water availability.

Here, we tease apart the function of the cultivable portion of the microbiome from the whole microbiome in retaining plant traits modified through artificial selection on flowering time. Specifically, the whole microbiome associated with earlier flowering time of Arabidopsis thaliana was cultivated on four types of solid media to create cultivated fractions of the microbiome. These cultivated microbiomes were subsequently preserved in glycerol, frozen, and revived to yield a portion of the cultivable fraction to compare (1) whole microbiome, (2) cultivable microbiome, and (3) revived, cultivable microbiome controls on early flowering time. Plants grown in soils inoculated with bacteria grown on 25 % Luria broth and 10 % tryptic soy agar retained the early flowering trait. An increase in leaf biomass with two of the cultivated microbiomes (49.4 and 38.5 %) contrasted the lowered biomass effect of the whole microbiome. Inoculation with the cultivated microbiomes that were cryopreserved in glycerol showed no effect on flowering time or leaf biomass. The results indicate that the cultivable portion of a plant's microbiome retains the early flowering effect in A. thaliana, but cryopreservation of the cultivated microbiomes disrupts the microbial effects on flowering time. Furthermore, the contrasting effects on leaf biomass (an indirect response from selection on early flowering time), seen with the whole microbiome versus the cultivable portion, suggests versatility in using cultivation methods to modify multiple traits of plants.

The mechanisms behind PGPR/plant interaction are poorly understood, as most studies have described short-term responses on plants and only a few studies have analyzed plant molecular responses under PGPR colonization. Here, we studied the effects of the PGPR bacterial model Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN on the whole life cycle of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We reported that at different plant developmental points, strain PsJN can be found in the rhizosphere and also colonizing their internal tissues. In early ontogeny, strain PsJN increased several growth parameters and accelerated growth rate of the plants. Also, an Arabidopsis transcriptome analysis revealed that 408 genes showed differential expression in PsJN-inoculated plants; some of these genes are involved in stress response and hormone pathways. Specifically, genes implicated in auxin and gibberellin pathways were induced. Quantitative transcriptional analyses of selected genes in different developmental stages revealed that the beginning of these changes could be evidenced early in development, especially among the down-regulated genes. The inoculation with heat-killed bacteria provoked a more severe transcriptional response in plants, but was not able to induce plant growth-promotion. Later in ontogeny, the growth rates of inoculated plants decreased with respect to the non-inoculated group and, interestingly, the inoculation accelerated the flowering time and the appearance of senescence signs in plants; these modifications correlate with the early up-regulation of flowering control genes. Then, we show that a single inoculation with a PGPR could affect the whole life cycle of a plant, accelerating its growth rate and shortening its vegetative period, both effects relevant for most crops. Thus, these findings provide novel and interesting aspects of these relevant biological interactions.

We have investigated the interaction between P. chlamydosporia and the model system Arabidopsis thaliana under laboratory conditions in the absence of nematodes. This study demonstrates that P. chlamydosporia colonizes A. thaliana. Root colonization monitored with green fluorescent protein-tagged P. chlamydosporia and quantitative PCR (qPCR) quantitation methods revealed root cell invasion. Fungal inoculation reduced flowering time and stimulated plant growth, as determined by total FW increase, faster development of inflorescences and siliques, and a higher yield in terms of seed production per plant. Precocious flowering was associated with significant expression changes in key floweringtime genes. In addition, we also provided molecular and genetic evidence that point towards jasmonate signaling as an important factor to modulate progression of plant colonization by the fungus. Our results indicate that P. chlamydosporia provides benefits to the plant in addition to its nematophagous activity. This report highlights the potential of P. chlamydosporia to improve yield in economically important crops.

Phenological drivers have largely been studied, but the role of plant microbiota, particularly rhizosphere microbiota, has not been considered.ResultsWe discovered that rhizosphere microbial communities could modulate the timing of flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana. Rhizosphere microorganisms that increased and prolonged N bioavailability by nitrification delayed flowering by converting tryptophan to the phytohormone indole acetic acid (IAA), thus downregulating genes that trigger flowering, and stimulating further plant growth. The addition of IAA to hydroponic cultures confirmed this metabolic network.ConclusionsWe document a novel metabolic network in which soil microbiota influenced plant flowering time, thus shedding light on the key role of soil microbiota on plant functioning. This opens up multiple opportunities for application, from helping to mitigate some of the effects of climate change and environmental stress on plants (e.g. abnormal temperature variation, drought, salinity) to manipulating plant characteristics using microbial inocula to increase crop potential.

The ecological effects of soil microbes on plant communities are well known, whereas less is known about their importance for plant evolutionary processes. In particular, the net effects of soil microbes on plant fitness may vary across environmental contexts and among plant genotypes, setting the stage for microbially mediated plant evolution. Here, we assess the effects of soil microbes on plant fitness and natural selection on flowering time in different environments. We performed two experiments in which we grew Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes replicated in either live or sterilized soil microbial treatments, and across varying levels of either competition (isolation, intraspecific competition or interspecific competition) or watering (well-watered or drought). We found large effects of competition and watering on plant fitness as well as the expression and natural selection of flowering time. Soil microbes increased average plant fitness under interspecific competition and drought and shaped the response of individual plant genotypes to drought. Finally, plant tolerance to either competition or drought was uncorrelated between soil microbial treatments suggesting that the plant traits favoured under environmental stress may depend on the presence of soil microbes. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that soil microbes can have large effects on plant fitness, which depend on both the environment and individual plant genotype. Future work in natural systems is needed for a complete understanding of the evolutionary importance of interactions between plants and soil microorganisms.

Here, we report a high level of reproducibility of soil microbiomes in altering plant flowering time and soil functions when partnered within and between plant hosts. We used a multi-generation experimental system using Arabidopsis thaliana Col to select for soil microbiomes inducing earlier or later flowering times of their hosts. We then inoculated the selected microbiomes from the tenth generation of plantings into the soils of three additional A. thaliana genotypes (Ler, Be, RLD) and a related crucifer (Brassica rapa). With the exception of Ler, all other plant hosts showed a shift in flowering time corresponding with the inoculation of early- or late-flowering microbiomes. Analysis of the soil microbial community using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing showed distinct microbiota profiles assembling by flowering time treatment. Plant hosts grown with the late-flowering-associated microbiomes showed consequent increases in inflorescence biomass for three A. thaliana genotypes and an increase in total biomass for B. rapa. The increase in biomass was correlated with two-to five-fold enhancement of microbial extracellular enzyme activities associated with nitrogen mineralization in soils. The reproducibility of the flowering phenotype across plant hosts suggests that microbiomes can be selected to modify plant traits and coordinate changes in soil resource pools.

Here, by using a sterile experimental system, we demonstrate that Sphingomonas sp. Cra20 promotes the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana by driving developmental plasticity in the roots, thus stimulating the growth of lateral roots and root hairs. By investigating the growth dynamics of A. thaliana in soil with different water-content, we demonstrate that Cra20 increases the growth rate of plants, but does not change the time of reproductive transition under well-water condition. The results further show that the application of Cra20 changes the rhizosphere indigenous bacterial community, which may be due to the change in root structure. Our findings provide new insights into the complex mechanisms of plant and bacterial interactions. The ability to promote the growth of plants under water-deficit can contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture.

Two-week-old seedlings of two A. thaliana ecotypes were inoculated with conidial suspensions (1.6 x 10(4) conidia/ml) and maintained in sterile conditions on microtitre plates for 25 days. The seedlings were assessed daily for flowering time, height at flowering and mortality. From this data the proportion of plants flowering was calculated and the susceptibility of each ecotype to individual isolate was quantified. The A. thaliana ecotypes were inoculated by several isolates of V. dahliae and V. longisporum with the disease symptoms observed being similar to those characteristic of Verticillium-infected Brassica napus. Responses to Verticillium isolates varied and for both ecotypes significant differences (P less than or equal to 0.05) were recorded in days to flowering between the V. longisporum isolates VD6 and VD12 and the V. dahliae isolate INRA617 and all other isolates. There were no other significant effects correlated with isolate origin or Verticillium species.

For this, the rhizosphere soils from both plant species were sampled four times during plant growth. Soil arylsulfatase (ARS) activity and the density and the structure of the cultivable ARS-BC on M9-Xsulf medium were then determined. ARS activity in rape rhizosphere was greater than in barley rhizosphere and evolved along the phenology in the two rhizosphere soils. in parallel, the average density of ARS-BC in the rape rhizosphere was higher than that in the barley rhizosphere. Moreover, ARS activity is correlated with ARS-BC density both in rape and barley rhizosphere soils. The structure of the ARS-BC in the rape rhizosphere was different from that in the barley rhizosphere. In the rape rhizosphere, the ARS-BC was substantially more structured than in the barley rhizosphere. Among the ARS-BC, Actinobacteria and Pseudomonads were significantly present in the both rhizosphere soils. Actinobacteria predominated in the barley rhizosphere while Pseudomonads were mostly represented under rape. It is possible that the differences in ARS activity observed between rape and barley can be attributed to a different ARS-BC size and/or a different ARS-BC structure under these two plant covers. This impact of rape may be connected to a selective effect of rhizodeposits released by rape roots to the functional bacterial community. Our findings suggest that plant species, via their rhizodeposits, may affect the functional bacterial community and thus influence the dynamic of S in soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Rapid responses of soil microorganisms improve plant fitness in novel environments	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						plant-microbe interaction; contemporary evolution; climate change; phenology; species interaction	RECENT CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES; ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS; CONTEMPORARY EVOLUTION; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; STRESS TOLERANCE; CHANGE IMPACTS; FOREST SOIL	Global change is challenging plant and animal populations with novel environmental conditions, including increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warmer temperatures, and altered precipitation regimes. In some cases, contemporary or rapid evolution can ameliorate the effects of global change. However, the direction and magnitude of evolutionary responses may be contingent upon interactions with other community members that also are experiencing novel environmental conditions. Here, we examine plant adaptation to drought stress in a multigeneration experiment that manipulated aboveground-belowground feedbacks between plants and soil microbial communities. Although drought stress reduced plant growth and accelerated plant phenologies, surprisingly, plant evolutionary responses to drought were relatively weak. In contrast, plant fitness in both drought and nondrought environments was linked strongly to the rapid responses of soil microbial community structure to moisture manipulations. Specifically, plants were most fit when their contemporary environmental conditions (wet vs. dry soil) matched the historical environmental conditions (wet vs. dry soil) of their associated microbial community. Together, our findings suggest that, when faced with environmental change, plants may not be limited to adapt or migrate strategies; instead, they also may benefit from association with interacting species, especially diverse soil microbial communities, that respond rapidly to environmental change.

Impact of Sclerotinia stem rot on yield of canola	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							BRASSICA-NAPUS; LEAF-SPOT; DISEASE; REDUCTION	Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is the causal agent of Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) of canola (Brassica napus). In North Dakota, the leading canola producer in the United States, SSR is an endemic disease. In order to estimate the impact of this disease on canola yield, field experiments were conducted from 2000 to 2004 at several locations in North Dakota and Minnesota. Experimental plots were either inoculated with laboratory-produced ascospores or infected by naturally occurring inoculum in commercial fields. Applying fungicides at different concentrations and timings during the flowering period created epiphytotics of diverse intensities. Disease incidence was measured once prior to harvesting the crop on 50 to 100 plants per plot. Results of the study indicated that 0.5% of the potential yield (equivalent to 12.75 kg/ha) was lost for every unit percentage of SSR incidence (range of 0.18 to 0.96%). Considering the current cost of fungicide applications and the market value of this commodity, a 17% SSR incidence could cause losses similar to the cost of a fungicide application. Additional efforts are required to improve current levels of tolerance of canola plants to this pathogen.

In this research we evaluated the effect of ten indigenous rhizobial isolates on the germination and growth of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) during seedling stage to produce more vigorous plants. One hundred seeds were planted/treatment in triplicate and inoculated with the bacterial cultures (1x10(8) cel.mL(-1)) plus a non-inoculated control, recording the germination during 8 days. Fifteen seedlings were transplanted/treatment to propagation trays with an inert sterile substrate, reinoculated and maintained for 30-45 days, to evaluate the effect on growth. The results were analyzed by Anova and compared with the control. The isolates RmBorbollon and ME01 were the most efficient to promote germination (P <= 0,05) in bell pepper. No effect was found for lettuce germination. The isolates ME01 and Med increased significantly (P <= 0,05) most growth variables in bell pepper and just a few in lettuce, which suggests some specificity of action between microorganisms and plant species. The strains were identified as belonging to the genera Ochrobactrum, Bradyrhizobium and Pseudomonas. It is concluded that these isolates, at exerting their promoter effect, may constitute promising strains for the formulation of biofertilizers.

The analysis of variance revealed the existence of significant amount of genetic variability in the material for all the traits. All the genotypes were treated with three treatments separately (Mesorhizobium sp. Strain CH 1233 (S1); Mesorhizobium sp. Strain CH 810 (S2); vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) (Glomus fasiculatum) and one set was used as uninoculated control. These were grown separately following randomized block design with three replications in each treatment. Comparative analysis indicated the differences between the treatments and behaviour of the genotypes in different environments. In general S1 and VAM showed beneficial interaction for maximum number of traits for all the genotypes. The effect of VAM was the most apparent among treatments. On overall basis, genotypes viz. HC 3, HC 5, GL 94022, ICC 5003LN, HK 2, GNG 663 and BG 362 were observed to be better performing and responsive to bio inoculants having one or more superior traits. These genotypes performing better for specific traits can be used as parents in hybridization programme for improvement of that particular trait.

The nodulation ability was not related to the capability to grow or produce melanin-like pigment in culture media at high temperatures. However, nodules formed at high temperatures were ineffective and plants did not accumulate N in shoots. Two thermal shocks of 40-degrees-C/8 h/day at flowering time drastically decreased nitrogenase activity and nodule relative efficiency of plants otherwise grown at 28-degrees-C. Recovery of nitrogenase activity began only after seven days, when new nodules formed; total incorporation of N in tops did not recover for 2 weeks. Non-inoculated beans receiving mineral N were not affected by the thermal shock, and when growing continuously at 35 or 38-degrees-C had total N accumulated in shoots reduced by only 18%.

Metal-tolerant plants growing on metalliferous soils are fascinating genetic and microbial resources. Seeds can vertically transmit endophytic microorganisms that can assist next generations to cope with environmental stresses, through yet poorly understood mechanisms. The aims of this study were to identify the core seed endophyte microbiome of the pioneer metallophyte Crotalaria pumila throughout three generations, and to better understand the plant colonisation of the seed endophyte Methylobacterium sp. Cp3. Strain Cp3 was detected in C. pumila seeds across three successive generations and showed the most dominant community member. When inoculated in the soil at the time of flowering, strain Cp3 migrated from soil to seeds. Using confocal microscopy, Cp3-mCherry was demonstrated to colonise the root cortex cells and xylem vessels of the stem under metal stress. Moreover, strain Cp3 showed genetic and in planta potential to promote seed germination and seedling development. We revealed, for the first time, that the seed microbiome of a pioneer plant growing in its natural environment, and the colonisation behaviour of an important plant growth promoting systemic seed endophyte. Future characterization of seed microbiota will lead to a better understanding of their functional contribution and the potential use for seed-fortification applications.

In polythene-house trials ZYMV:WK inoculated plants were up to 10 days later in flowering than uninoculated plants and their cumulative yields were between 5% and 26% less than uninoculated plants depending on the cultivar. In most field trials cumulative yields from inoculated plants were between 4% and 38% less than uninoculated plants depending on the site and cultivar, but in one trial the yield was 7% higher from inoculated plants. In all experiments, courgette and marrow fruits harvested from ZYMV:WK inoculated plants were symptomless and indistinguishable from fruit harvested from uninoculated plants. The mild leaf symptoms induced by ZYMV:WK infection did not intensify to severe leaf symptoms and where there were natural outbreaks of severe ZYMV infection, fruits from inoculated plants remained symptomless whilst those from uninoculated plants were severely affected and unmarketable.

Variation in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization modifies the expression of tolerance to above-ground defoliation	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						compensation; defences; ecological interactions; herbivory; multitrophic interactions; mycorrhizal fungi; tolerance	DATURA-STRAMONIUM L; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; PLANT TOLERANCE; HERBIVORY; RESISTANCE; DAMAGE; PRECISION; CONTINUUM; SELECTION; ENEMIES	P>1. Plant association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has been considered a factor increasing plant tolerance to herbivory. However, this positive effect could decrease with colonization density if the benefit : cost ratio of the AMF-plant association changes. We measured plant performance and tolerance to defoliation across a gradient of commercial AMF (Glomus sp.) inoculum concentration. 2. Six genetic families of Datura stramonium were grown under greenhouse conditions and subjected to five increasing levels of AMF inoculum concentration and to defoliation treatments, i.e. the presence/absence of 50% artificial damage, following a full-factorial design. 3. AMF colonization increased linearly with inoculum concentration while foliar area, root mass, flowering phenology and seed production expressed nonlinear functions. Plant genetic variation in the benefit function of AMF colonization was also detected. We show a negative interaction between AMF concentration and plant tolerance to defoliation. 4. Synthesis. The negative correlation between plant tolerance and AMF concentration suggests that defoliation can reduce AMF benefits and that natural variations in AMF can limit the evolution of optimum levels of tolerance. Moreover, genetic variation in the shape of the reaction norms to AMF in the presence/absence of defoliation suggests that plants may evolve in response to variation in densities of AMF and herbivores.

Elsholtzia splendens is an indicator species for the presence of copper (Cu) mines because both its flowering phenology and reproduction are tolerant to heavy metals. To test whether effects of Cu on the flowering phenology and reproduction of E. splendens depend on the presence of AMF, we conducted a factorial experiment with two Cu treatments (with or without Cu addition) crossed with two AMF treatments (with or without AMF inoculation). Without AMF, Cu addition significantly delayed the onset dates, ending dates and peak dates of flowering and decreased flowering duration. However, AMF inoculation reversed the effects of Cu stress, with recovered flowering onset and ending dates and increased the flowering duration. Cu addition significantly decreased inflorescence width and number, inflorescence biomass, vegetative biomass and total seed number, but significantly increased 1000-seed weight. AMF inoculation significantly increased vegetative biomass. Two-way ANOVA results showed that the interactive effects between Cu addition and AMF inoculation were significant on the inflorescence number, vegetative biomass and total seed number. These results indicate that AMF can alleviate the Cu stress on the flowering phenology and reproduction of E. splendens.

Since the inoculants were not adapted to the climatic conditions, their beneficial effects decreased rapidly. With the objective of evaluating the possibilities of improving inoculation, the nodulation capacity of a presumptive inoculant and its persistence under different clopping regimes with or without the host were studied in field experiments in the Argentine soybean production area. Crop rotations included soybean inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain E110 (presumptive inoculant), in the first year followed by maize, or a soybean-soybean rotation using soybean with or without inoculation with E110. Initially, the soil lacked Bradyrhizobium japonicum. A naturalized strain isolated originally from the soybean area, E112, was therefore introduced into the soil to represent the indigenous population to facilitate inter-strain competition studies. Movement of rhizobia in soils was restricted by polyethene barriers placed to a depth of 10 cm, Bacterial strains from nodules at flowering time of soybean plants were identified by ELISA. Strain E110 required at least three seasons as an inoculant before it was able to dominate nodule occupancy. However, it proved capable for persisting in soil for up to 5 years in the absence of the host and could therefore be recommended for use as an inoculant from the standpoint of its competitive abilities and persistence.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of cultivation systems, associated or not with an inoculant, in the precocity of soybean cultivars at the green grain growth stage. The research was led in field conditions, in CCA/UFPB, Areia-PB with an experimental design in randomized blocks, in sub-subdivided plots (3 x 2 x 2), three cultivars (Pati, JLM 004 and Pirarara), with and without inoculation and in systems of single cultivation and intercropped with corn, with four replicates. Cultivar precocity was evaluated through the numbers of days until emergence, flowering, and maturation, the reproductive period and the number of harvested plants. The cultivar JLM 004 features the longest emergence period, but it develops to the other reproductive phases in less time and with lower number of plants at harvest; cultivar Pirarara presents the longest time for the reproductive cycle, the same as cultivar Pati, when intercropped and with inoculation; the intercrop system and the inoculation increase the number of days for the maturation of cultivar Pati, while the monocrop system and without inoculation extends the necessary time for the maturation Of cultivar Pirarara.

In this study, rhizosphere effects of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) on SOM decomposition were investigated at four phenological stages under three levels of fertilization in a greenhouse experiment using natural C-13 tracers. The magnitude of the rhizosphere effect ranged from 0% to as high as 383% above the decomposition rate in the no-plant control, indicating that the rhizosphere priming can substantially intensify decomposition. The rhizosphere priming effect was responsible for a major portion of the total soil C efflux. Cumulative soil C loss caused by rhizosphere effects during the whole growing season equated to the amount of root biomass C for the soybean treatment, and 71% of root biomass C for the wheat treatment. Different plant species produced significantly different rhizosphere priming effects. The overall rhizosphere priming effect of soybean plants was significantly higher than for wheat plants. Plant phenology significantly influenced the rhizosphere priming effect. Little rhizosphere effect occurred in both wheat and soybean treatments initially. The priming effect of the wheat rhizosphere reached 287% above the no-plant control at the flowering stage and declined significantly afterward. The priming effect of the soybean rhizosphere peaked at 383% above the no-plant control during the late vegetative stage and remained at high levels onward. Contrary to many published reports, NPK fertilization did not significantly modify the rhizosphere priming effect.

Sunflower is a trendy oilfield crop and variation in its varieties is associated with the dynamics of endophytic diversity. The present study is undertaken to identify and compare the ecological niche of endophytic bacterial communities amongst different tissues of two hybrids varieties Hysun-33 and Hysun-39 of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) at three developmental stages which are vegetative stage I (after 15 days of seeds germination), vegetative stage II (after 30 days of germination) and reproductive stage (after 90 days of germination). A total of 74 endophytes from Hysun-33 and 115 endophytes from Hysun-39 have been isolated from different tissues and growth stages. Amongst plant parts, root tissues harbored higher bacterial inhabitants (44) followed by stem (33), leaf (30) and flower (7) of Hysun-39. Likewise, Hysun-33 endophytes colonized roots more abundantly followed by leaves, stem and flowers. All strains are found to be gram positive with the exception of only RA9 from Hysun-33 and RB9 from Hysun-39 that are gram negative. Among different growth stages, the maximum bacterial population (CFU of 320 x 10(3)) was found amongst root microflora at vegetative stage II of plant in Hysun-39 variety as compared to root endophytes of Hysun-33 having (CFU of 10 x 10(3)). The evaluation of their growth promoting features revealed that among 74 isolates of Hysun-33, 70% exhibited the ability of hydrogen cyanide production, 43% IAA production, 36% siderophore production and 4% nitrogen fixation and also phosphate solubilization. However among 115 isolates of Hysun-39, 64% appeared as hydrogen cyanide producers, 56% IAA producers, 33% siderophore producers, 2% nitrogen fixers and 4% as phosphate solubilizers. Therefore our study reveals understanding of wide-ranging diversity of endophytic bacteria and their beneficial relationship with internal tissues of host plant which may recommend their implementation to crops for better development of agricultural systems.

Soil microbial communities are diverse and have a large impact, both positive and negative, on the host plant. However, owing to few available studies, how the soil microbial community may influence the evolutionary response of plant populations is not well understood. Here we sought to uncover whether belowground microbial communities act as an agent of selection on flowering and growth traits in the common morning glory, Ipomoea purpurea. Methods We performed a controlled greenhouse experiment in which genetic lines of I. purpurea were planted into either sterilized soils or in soils that were sterilized and inoculated with the microbial community from original field soil. We could thus directly test the influence of alterations to the microbial community on plant growth, flowering, and fitness and assess patterns of selection in both soil microbial environments. Results A more complex soil microbial community resulted in larger plants that produced more flowers. Selection strongly favored earlier flowering when plants were grown in the complex microbial environment than compared to sterilized soil. We also uncovered a pattern of negative correlational selection on growth rate and flowering time, indicating that selection favored different combinations of growth and flowering traits in the simplified versus complex soil community. Conclusions Together, these results suggest the soil microbial community is a selective agent on flowering time and ultimately that soil microbial community influences important plant evolutionary processes.

Influence of genotypes and inoculation method on productivity of lentil (Lens culinaris) under dryland temperate conditions of Kashmir valley	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						genotypes; lentil; Lens culinaris; nodulation; Pseudomonas; Rhizobium; symbiotic performance; yield	RHIZOBIUM; STRAINS; COMPETITIVENESS	A field experiment was conducted during winter (rabi) seasons of 2005-06 and 2006-07 at Regional Research Station of the University, Wadura, Sopore (Jammu & Kashmir) to find out the relative performance of 3 genotypes ('SKL 9', 'SKL 16' and 'Shalimar Masoor l') and inoculation methods on growth, yield, N and P uptake and nodulation of lentil (Lens culinaris Medik). The mean performance indicated significant superiority of 'Shalimar Masoor V to 'SKL 16' and 'SKL 9' in terms of growth, yield attributes, grain yield (0.81, 0.72 and 0.64 tonnes/ha), N and P uptake and nodulation and also recorded marked reduction in days (5.9 days) to flowering and maturity. Rhizobium inoculation with seed and soil inoculation methods significantly improved the growth, yield attributes, grain yield, straw yield, nodulation and N and P uptake in lentil. Pseudomonas alone either seed inoculated or soil inoculated recorded markedly more number and dry weight of nodules at all the intervals and growth and yield attributes and yield over uninoculated control. Seed inoculation with Pseudomonas markedly enhanced dry matter production (142.6 g/m row), grains/pod (1.69), grain weight/plant (1.45 g), grain yield (0.72 tonnes/ha), straw yield, N and P uptake and nodulation at all the intervals over soil inoculation with Pseudomonas was at par in terms of days to flowering and maturity and pods/plant. Dual inoculation of Rhizobium+Pseudomonas with both the methods recorded significantly higher number and dry weight of nodules, N and P uptake, yield, yield attributes and growth parameters over individual inoculation with Rhizobium and Pseudomonas with respective methods. Dual inoculation of seed with Rhizobium+Pseudomonas markedly gave 21.2 and 48.9% higher grain yield and 28.5 and 55.9% more straw yield over the dual inoculation of soil with Rhizobium+Pseudomonas and uninoculated control respectively. Seed inoculation method gave more occupancy in nodules than soil inoculation with all the treatments. Dual inoculation of Rhizobium+Pseudomonas recorded markedly higher nodule occupancy than Rhizobium alone at different root portions with both seed and soil inoculation methods.	[Singh, U.; Saad, A.

Effects of the Neotyphodium endophyte fungus on dormancy and germination rate of Lolium multiflorum seeds	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						dormancy; germination rate; Lolium multiflorum; maternal effect; Neotyphodium	HYDROTHERMAL TIME; GROWTH; PSEUDOREPLICATION; TEMPERATURE; POPULATIONS; GRASSES	Neotyphodium frequently occurs as an endophyte in grasses. Evidence shows enhanced fitness of endophyte infected grasses relative to non-infected ones. Some studies of seed germination show endophyte enhancement of plant fitness in various environments, but inconsistent results indicate that further studies are needed. So far, experiments have failed to separate the confounded effects of population origin and seed management. For this reason, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed dormancy and germination in Lolium multiflorum using an experimental design controlling these factors. Depending on the year of seed production, endophyte infection modified seed response to light quality, affecting predominantly seed dormancy levels. Nevertheless, the endophyte did not affect base temperature or thermal time of germination. We concluded that endophytes were not a strong influence on germination behaviour. We speculate from our results that the presence of the endophyte changes germination by an indirect effect, in extending growth of the maternal plant during seed development and ripening. The direct effect of hyphae in the seed on seed behaviour was disregarded, because the difference between infected and non-infected seed varied within the year of seed production. Future experiments should focus on effects of the endophyte on the canopy of parent plants during seed production and ripening, and, hence, on subsequent dormancy and germination of the seeds.

One-centimeter stem segments of 28-day-old plants of cultivar Yandee were inoculated with a suspension of 1 x 10(6) conidia ml-1 and kept under high humidity for 48 hr. Stem segments were excised, and the epidermis was examined after stripping a three-cell layer from the subepidermal tissue at 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 hr and at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 20 days after inoculation. Germination of conidia was 100% on nutrient agar, but germ tubes did not develop when inoculated onto stems in water suspensions. On stems, germination could be observed only as a stained attachment to the cuticle in 97% of conidia. Four days after inoculation, penetration of the cuticle was observed through this attachment directly beneath the conidia, without the formation of an appressorium. Penetration was arrested between the cuticle and the epidermis, where a distinctive coralloid mycelium was visible by 7 days after inoculation. At 20 days, these coralloid structures were present at a mean frequency of 148/cm2 with a mean length of 192-mu-m and mean width of 101-mu-m. Plants remained symptomless 20 days after inoculation. Germination of conidia was also 97% on stems of resistant breeding line 75A258. However, on 75A258, the coralloid infection structures were rare (0.8/cm2), and all were less than 10-mu-m in length and width. These coralloid structures were observed occasionally in symptomless green plants from the field and were present on mature stems coincident with symptoms of Phomopsis stem blight. Normal mycelia were observed to invade the subepidermal tissue of senescent stems from the coralloid hyphae. This is the first known report of a coralloid subcuticular infection structure for Phomopsis spp. on any host plant.

Plant growth rate and nitrogen uptake shape rhizosphere bacterial community composition and activity in an agricultural field	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						bacterial community; extracellular enzymes; microbiome; nitrogen; rhizosphere	SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; ROOT MICROBIOME; ENZYME-ACTIVITY; TRAITS; MAIZE; DIVERSITY; CARBON; MINERALIZATION; AGROECOSYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENT	Plant-microbial interactions in the rhizosphere are an essential link in soil nitrogen (N) cycling and plant N supply. Plant phenotype and genotype interact with the soil environment to determine rhizosphere community structure and activity. However, the relative contributions of plant identity, phenology and soil resource availability in shaping rhizosphere effects are not well understood. Four summer annuals and a collection of maize hybrids were grown in a common garden experiment conducted at two levels of organic nutrient availability. Plant biomass, N accumulation, rhizosphere bacterial community composition, and rhizosphere potential extracellular enzyme activity were assessed at vegetative, flowering and grain-filling stages of maize. Plant N uptake was strongly coupled with protease activity in the rhizosphere. Temporal trends in rhizosphere community composition varied between plant species. Changes in rhizosphere community composition could be explained by variation in plant growth dynamics. These findings indicate that species-level variation in plant growth dynamics and resource acquisition drive variation in rhizosphere bacterial community composition and activity linked to plant N uptake.

Fungal Endophytes in Knock Out (R) Rose and Performance Effects of Entomopathogens on Marigold and Zinnia	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article						ornamentals; seed coating; inoculation; germination; plant growth	BEAUVERIA-BASSIANA; PLANT-GROWTH; TEMPERATURE; ALTERNARIA; ISOLATE; PATHOGENICITY; COLONIZATION; INOCULATION; GERMINATION; DIVERSITY	Endophytic fungi are increasingly studied for their ability to enhance plant performance in field crops, yet there are few equivalent studies in floricultural crops. Given the economic importance of these crops and pressures faced by growers to produce plants of high aesthetic quality, we surveyed the natural occurrence of foliar fungal endophytes in Knock Out (R) roses to identify candidate beneficial isolates. We also tested the effects of entomopathogenic fungal inocula on marigold and zinnia plant growth using different application approaches. Our survey of Knock Out (R) rose foliage collected from five sites within central Texas revealed at least 24 different fungal genera and 30 probable species, including some isolates providing plant stress tolerance and pathogens or antagonists of insects and nematode pests. The effects of entomopathogen inocula on plant growth varied with host plant (marigold vs. zinnia) and inoculation method (soil drench vs. seed soak). Plant responses were complex, but inoculation with Isaria fumosorosea Wize tended to have a negative effect on plant performance characteristics whereas Beauveria bassiana (Bals.-Criv.) Vuill. tended to have positive effects. When applied to marigold as a seedcoating, I. fumosorosea reduced germination, seedling fresh weight, and produced seedlings with a less compact form. By contrast, seeds inoculated with B. bassiana required less time to germinate, had higher germination rates, and increased the plant compactness. These results show that the impact of fungal entomopathogens applied as endophytes depends on the specific fungi-plant combination being examined. The effect of plant inoculation with entomopathogenic fungi within a pest management context requires further evaluation.

Here, we conducted a pot experiment to test whether life cycle and flowering phenology traits of host plant Medicago truncatula Gaertn can be altered by AMF under low and high soil phosphorus (P) levels. Methods The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at Zhejiang University in China (120 degrees 19'E, 30 degrees 26'N) and had a completely randomized design with two factors: AMF treatments and soil P levels. Six AMF species (Acaulospora scrobiculata, As; Gigaspora margarita, Gma; Funneliformis geosporum, Fg; Rhizophagus intraradices, Ri; Funneliformis mosseae, Fmo and Glomus tortuosum, Gt.) were used, and two soil P levels (24.0 and 5.7 mg kg(-1) Olsen-soluble P) were designed. The six AMF species were separately inoculated or in a mixture (Mix), and a non-AMF control (NAMF) was included. When plants began to flower, the number of flowers in each pot was recorded daily. During fruit ripening, the number of mature fruits was also recorded daily. After similar to 4 months, the biomass, biomass P content and AMF colonization of host plant were measured. Correlation between root colonization and first flowering time, or P content and first flowering time was analyzed. Important Findings Under the low P level, first flowering time negatively correlated with root colonization and biomass P. Only host plants with AMF species As, Fg, Ri, or Mix were able to complete their life cycle within 112 days after sowing. And treatment with AMF species Fg, Gt, or As resulted in two periods of rapid flower production while other fungi treatments resulted in only one within 112 days after sowing. The cumulative number of flowers produced and biomass P content were highest with species Fg. Host biomass allocation significantly differed depending on the species of AMF. Under both soil P levels, the host plant tended to allocate more biomass to fruits in the Mix treatment than in the other treatments. These results indicated that the effects of AMF on host flowering phenology and biomass allocation differed depending on AMF species and soil P levels.

This study addresses whether seeds are passive carriers or engage a molecular dialogue with pathogens during their development. We developed two pathosystems using Medicago truncatula with Xanthomonas alfalfae subsp. alfalfae (Xaa), the natural Medicago sp. pathogen and Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), a Brassicaceae pathogen. Three days after flower inoculation, the transcriptome of Xcc-infected pods showed activation of an innate immune response that was strongly limited in Xcc mutated in the type three secretion system, demonstrating an incompatible interaction of Xcc with the reproductive structures. In contrast, the presence of Xaa did not result in an activation of defence genes. Transcriptome profiling during development of infected seeds exhibited time-dependent and differential responses to Xcc and Xaa. Gene network analysis revealed that the transcriptome of Xcc-infected seeds was mainly affected during seed filling whereas that of Xaa-infected seeds responded during late maturation. The Xcc-infected seed transcriptome exhibited an activation of defence response and a repression of targeted seed maturation pathways. Fifty-one percent of putative ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 targets were deregulated by Xcc, including oleosin, cupin, legumin and chlorophyll degradation genes. At maturity, these seeds displayed decreased weight and increased chlorophyll content. In contrast, these traits were not affected by Xaa infection. These findings demonstrate the existence of a complex molecular dialogue between xanthomonads and developing seeds and provides insights into a previously unexplored trade-off between seed development and pathogen defence.

From plant fungi to bee parasites: mycorrhizae and soil nutrients shape floral chemistry and bee pathogens	ECOLOGY			English	Article						alkaloid; bee decline; bee parasites; Bombus impatiens; Crithidia; floral chemistry; multitrophic effects; mycorrhizae; soil; trypanosome	DISEASE; POLLINATORS; LIMITATION; INCREASE; IMPACTS; REWARDS; DEFENSE; REVEAL	Bee populations have experienced declines in recent years, due in part to increased disease incidence. Multiple factors influence bee-pathogen interactions, including nectar and pollen quality and secondary metabolites. However, we lack an understanding of how plant interactions with their environment shape bee diet quality. We examined how plant interactions with the belowground environment alter floral rewards and, in turn, bee-pathogen interactions. Soil-dwelling mycorrhizal fungi are considered plant mutualists, although the outcome of the relationship depends on environmental conditions such as nutrients. In a 2 x 2 factorial design, we asked whether mycorrhizal fungi and nutrients affect concentrations of nectar and pollen alkaloids (anabasine and nicotine) previously shown to reduce infection by the gut pathogen Crithidia in the native bumble bee Bombus impatiens. To ask how plant interactions affect this common bee pathogen, we fed pollen and nectar from our treatment plants, and from a wildflower pollen control with artificial nectar, to bees infected with Crithidia. Mycorrhizal fungi and fertilizer both influenced flowering phenology and floral chemistry. While we found no anabasine or nicotine in nectar, high fertilizer increased anabasine and nicotine in pollen. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) decreased nicotine concentrations, but the reduction due to AMF was stronger in high than low-nutrient conditions. AMF and nutrients also had interactive effects on bee pathogens via changes in nectar and pollen. High fertilizer reduced Crithidia cell counts relative to low fertilizer in AMF plants, but increased Crithidia in non-AMF plants. These results did not correspond with effects of fertilizer and AMF on pollen alkaloid concentrations, suggesting that other components of pollen or nectar were affected by treatments and shaped pathogen counts. Our results indicate that soil biotic and abiotic environment can alter bee-pathogen interactions via changes in floral rewards, and underscore the importance of integrative studies to predict disease dynamics and ecological outcomes.

To assess the selective effect of host plant on its microsymbionts, the influence of the pea (Pisum sativum) genotype on the relative nodulation success of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae (Rlv) genotypes from the soil populations during plant development has been investigated. Five pea lines were chosen for their genetic variability in root and nodule development. Genetic structure and diversity of Rlv populations sampled from nodules were estimated by molecular typing with a marker of the genomic background (rDNA intergenic spacer) and a nodulation gene marker (nodD region). Differences were found among Rlv populations related to pea genetic background but also to modification of plant development caused by single gene mutation. The growth stage of the host plant also influenced structuring of populations. A particular nodulation genotype formed the majority of nodules during the reproductive stage. Overall, modification in root and nodule development appears to strongly influence the capacity of particular rhizobial genotypes to form nodules.

Germination and seedling emergence responses of common bean and cowpea to plant extract seed treatments	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY; IN-VITRO; PATHOGENS; PEA; ULTRASTRUCTURE; AGRICULTURE; COTYLEDONS; IMBIBITION; FUNGICIDES; DISEASE	The present study was initiated to investigate the effect of crude plant extracts as seed treatments on Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) and Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) seed germination and emergence in the presence of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum and Colletotrichum dematium, respectively. Common bean and cowpea seeds were treated with crude water and acetone extracts of Agapanthus caulescens Spreng., Allium sativum L., Carica papaya L. and Syzygium cordatum Hochst. ex Krauss at 5 and 15 mg/ml concentrations. Seeds treated with the synthetic fungicide fludioxonil+ mefenoxam (the commercial product Celest (R) XL) represented the positive control, whereas dimethyl sulphoxide and water-soaked seeds represented negative controls. The rolled paper towel method of the International Seed Testing Association was used to investigate the effect of the treatments on seed germination. Mean emergence time (MET) was determined using seed inoculated with the respective pathogens. The changes in the ultrastructure of embryonic roots and the connecting tissues of embryo-cotyledon of common bean and cowpea treated with Syzygium acetone extracts and Agapanthus water extracts were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High germination percentages of > 90% were observed in bean seeds from two production seasons treated with low concentrations of water extracts of Allium, Syzygium and Agapanthus and acetone extracts of Allium, Agapanthus and Carica. These treatments also recorded high emergence percentages with low MET values, which were similar to the water control. Cowpea seeds treated with Carica water extract had the highest germination and emergence. Syzygium acetone was the only extract that gave higher germination and emergence in both IT93K5132 and PAN 311 varieties. Therefore, Carica water and Syzygium acetone extracts can be considered as potential bean and cowpea seed treatments. Generally, there were inconsistencies in terms of correlations of germination with emergence percentages in both cowpea and bean seed treated with plant extracts used in the study, which could be due to differences in vigour. The TEM study of embryo-cotyledon tissue of both species revealed that Syzygium and Agapanthus extract seed treatment may accelerate metabolic processes as evidenced by the presence of vacuoles, many cristae and few lipid bodies.

These were termed trifoliates and multifoliates, respectively. The trifoliates did not increase in size or undergo visible signs of development including flowering or senescence. The multifoliates increased in height by 4 to 5 times, flowered, set seed and senesced. Both plantlet types were nodulated by four strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The timing of nodulation and the nodule phenotype were indistinguishable from those observed when seed-grown plants were nodulated by the same strains. As in seed-grown plants, nitrogen fixation in multifoliates declined just prior to flowering. Since the same decline was observed in non-flowering trifoliates, it is unlikely that flowering and seed set, alone, are responsible for the observed decline in nitrogen fixation.

Assessing the intensity of Fusarium-damage in wheat: A comparison of selected disease parameters during disease development and the role of fungicides	JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION			English	Article						deoxynivalenol; epidemiology; quantification of fungal DNA	WINTER-WHEAT; BLIGHT; CULTIVAR; TILLAGE; GRAIN; CROP	Disease severity (% of Fusarium-damaged spikelets), disease incidence (% of Fusarium-damaged wheat heads), Fusarium graminearurn DNA (pg per ng total DNA), deoxynivalenol (DON) content (mg DON per kg grain dry mass) and yield (t per ha) were recorded in a field experiment carried out in Northern Germany. Plants (susceptible cultivar Ritmo) were inoculated at anthesis by overhead application of a E graminearum mycelial suspension during a 6.7 mm precipitation event. Fungicides were applied around the time of wheat anthesis to generate different levels of Fusarium-damage. Infected heads were sampled in two-week-intervals post inoculation. Disease incidence increased almost linearly with time, reaching levels of about 80% at four weeks post inoculation. Disease severity increased in a slightly exponential manner with time, reaching levels of about 60% after four weeks. Six weeks after inoculation, Fusarium head blight symptoms could not be distinguished from blighting of wheat heads due to plant senescence anymore. The ratio of F. graminearum DNA and total DNA increased exponentially with time up to four weeks post inoculation. Relationships between fungal DNA and yield or DON were closer when DNA was extracted two weeks post anthesis in comparison with four weeks post anthesis. Hence, quantification of fungal DNA seems to be advantageous for assessing FHB in wheat at early stages of disease development. In the middle of disease development, disease severity allowed the most precise estimation of yield and DON contents. Towards the end of disease development, the DON content was the most useful variable to describe the intensity of Fusarium-damage, because it could be evaluated in senescent plant material. Yield of infected plants increased from about 6.5 to 10 t ha(-1) upon fungicide (Caramba, Folicur, or Input) application at two days before or two days after anthesis. Effects were smaller when fungicides were applied earlier or later. At equal application time, equal disease severity level, and equal fungal DNA concentration, effects of fungicides on yield were not significantly different (P = 0.734) whereas effects on the DON content were (P < 0.001).Folicur applied around the time of wheat anthesis decreased the DON content of the grain from about 14 mg kg(-1) to 9 mg kg(-1) whereas Caramba and Input decreased the DON content to about 5 mg kg(-1).

In this study, we investigated the impact of organic and mineral fertilizers on the AMF community composition and content of Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) in a field experimental station which was established in 1979, in the Loess Plateau of China. Roots and soils were sampled three times during the growing period of winter wheat in 2008. The treatments including: N (inorganic N), NP (inorganic N and P), SNP (straw, inorganic N and P), M (farmyard manure), MNP (farmyard manure, inorganic N and P), and CK (no fertilization). AMF communities of root and soil samples were analyzed using PCR-DGGE, cloning and sequencing techniques; and GRSP content was determined by Bradford assay. Our results indicated that spore density, GRSP, and AMF community varied significantly in soils of long-term fertilization plots at three different wheat growing stages. The effects of wheat growing period on AMF community in roots were much more evident than fertilization regimes. However, the diversity of AMF was low in our study field. Up to five AMF phylotypes appeared in each sample, with the overwhelming dominance of a Glomus-like phylotype affiliated to G. mosseae. GRSP content was correlated positively with organic carbon, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, soil pH, and spore densities, but correlated negatively with soil C/N (P < 0.05). The results of our study highlight that the richness of AMF in Loess Plateau agricultural region is low, and long-term fertilization, especially amendments with manure and straw, has beneficial effects on accumulation of soil organic carbon, spore density, GRSP content, and AMF diversity. Host phenology, edaphic factors (influenced by long-term fertilization), and habitats interacted to affect the AMF community and agoecosystem functioning. Additionally, soil moisture and pH make a greater contribution than other determined soil parameters to the AMF community dynamics in such a special semi-arid agroecosystem where crops rely greatly on rainfall.

There is evidence that plant species and genotypes select distinct rhizosphere communities, however, knowledge of the drivers and extent of this variation remains limited. We grew 11 annual species and 11 maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) inbred lines in a common garden experiment to assess the influence of host phylogeny, growth, and nitrogen metabolism on rhizosphere communities. Growth characteristics, bacterial community composition and potential activity of extracellular enzymes were assayed at time of flowering, when plant nitrogen demand is maximal. Bacterial community composition varied significantly between different plant species and genotypes. Rhizosphere beta-diversity was positively correlated with phylogenetic distance between plant species, but not genetic distance within a plant species. In particular, life history traits associated with plant resource acquisition (e.g., longer lifespan, high nitrogen use efficiency, and larger seed size) were correlated with variation in bacterial community composition and enzyme activity. These results indicate that plant evolutionary history and life history strategy influence rhizosphere bacterial community composition and activity. Thus, incorporating phylogenetic or functional diversity into crop rotations may be a tool to manipulate plant-microbe interactions in agricultural systems.

Soil bacterial communities of wheat vary across the growing season and among dryland farming systems	GEODERMA			English	Article						16S rRNA gene; Conventional; Organic; Tillage; Grazing; Weed diversity	PLANT-SPECIES IDENTITY; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; CROPPING SYSTEMS; SPRING WHEAT; SP NOV.; DIVERSITY; RESILIENCE; MANAGEMENT; BIOTA; GRASSLAND	Despite knowledge that management practices, seasonality, and plant phenology impact soil microbiota; farming system effects on soil microbiota are not often evaluated across the growing season. We assessed the bacterial diversity in soil around wheat roots through the spring and summer of 2016 in winter wheat (Triticum aestivium L.) in Montana, USA, from three contrasting farming systems: a chemically-managed no-tillage system, and two USDA-certified organic systems in their fourth year, one including tillage and one where sheep grazing partially offsets tillage frequency. Bacterial richness (range 605-1174 OTUs) and evenness (range 0.80-0.92) peaked in early June and dropped by late July (range 92-1190, 0.62-0.92, respectively), but was not different by farming systems. Organic tilled plots contained more putative nitrogen-fixing bacterial genera than the other two systems. Bacterial community similarities were significantly altered by sampling date, minimum and maximum temperature at sampling, bacterial abundance at date of sampling, total weed richness, and coverage of Taraxacum officinale, Lamium ampleuxicaule, and Thlaspi arvense. This study highlights that weed diversity, season, and farming management system all influence soil microbial communities. Local environmental conditions will strongly condition any practical applications aimed at improving soil diversity, especially in semiarid regions where abiotic stress and seasonal variability in temperature and water availability drive primary production. Thus, it is critical to incorporate or address seasonality in soil sampling for microbial diversity.

In 2011, five segregating populations with a total of 445 genotypes were grown at two locations in Germany. Plants were inoculated with BYDV-PAV transmitted by aphids of the species Rhopalosiphum padi. We observed considerable genotypic variance for the traits virus concentration as measured by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) as well as expression of symptoms. Furthermore, heritabilities were high for the plant performance traits ear height and plant height. Correlation coefficients between all pairs of traits were significantly different from 0 (P < 0.05). Genotypes of the inoculated variant were reduced in plant height by 3 cm, ear height by 6 cm, and flowered 3 days earlier compared to genotypes of the non-inoculated variant. The results of our study suggested a high potential for breeding of BVDY resistant / tolerant maize.

Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Association in Genetically Modified Drought-Tolerant Corn	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							PLANTS; SOIL; COLONIZATION; STRESS; PHOSPHORUS; SYMBIOSIS; PATHWAYS; ETHYLENE; IMPACT; ROOTS	The commercial use of genetically modified (GM) plants has significantly increased worldwide. The interactions between GM plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are of considerable importance given the agricultural and ecological role of AM and the lack of knowledge regarding potential effects of drought-tolerant GM corn (Zea mays L.) on AM fungal symbiosis. This work studied AM fungal colonization in five corn lines growing under two different irrigation regimes (30 and 100% of soil field capacity [SFC]). Four of the lines were GM corn, and two of these were drought tolerant. The experiment was conducted for 60 d in a growth chamber under constant irrigation, after which mycorrhization, corn biomass, and days to plant senescence (DTS) were evaluated. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species of the order Diversisporales were predominant in the soil inocula. At the end of the experiment, all plants showed AM colonization. Mycorrhization was higher at 30% SFC than at 100% SFC. Within the same corn line, the AM fungi produced more vesicles in plant roots under drought stress. Among treatments, DTS varied significantly, and drought-tolerant GM corn lines survived longer than the wild-type corn when maintained at 100% SFC. Corn biomass did not vary among treatments, and no correlations were found between DTS or biomass and mycorrhization. We conclude that overexpression of the Hahb-4 gene in corn plants under the experimental conditions of this study did not affect AM fungal infectivity and improved the tolerance of the corn to drought stress.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonisation of Cry3 toxin-producing Bt maize and near isogenic maize	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						genetically modified plants (GMPs); AMF colonisation; Zea mays L.; side effect; Bacillus thuringiensis	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; SOIL; IMPACT; CROPS; CORN; COMMUNITIES; MICROCOSMS; PLANTS; ROOTS; DNA	Despite the fact that, on average, approximately 5-6 metric tons/ha of Bt maize stubble enter the soil on more than 170 million of hectares worldwide, the environmental impact of genetically modified maize plants on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is poorly known. In this study, the mycorrhizal colonisation on the roots of Bt maize (DAS-59122-7) and its near isogenic line was examined during the whole vegetation period. Cry3 toxin-producing Bt maize and its near isogenic line were grown in an experimental field in Julianna-major, Nagykovacsi, Hungary. DAS-59122-7 maize produces Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1 toxins and pat proteins for herbicide tolerance. The study assessed whether similar arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation can be observed on the root of the Bt and near isogenic maize line and whether there are any differences in the temporal dynamics of AMF development. The arbuscular, hyphal and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonisation were higher in the near isogenic line as compared to its Bt counterpart, but no significant effect of the maize line was found as regards vesicle colonisation. The intensity of the arbuscular infection increased over time during plant maturation. DAS-59122-7 Bt maize had a negative effect on the initial development of AMF under field conditions, but no difference was seen in the case of the last two sampling dates (day 82 and 135). The reason of the latter is still not known.

Resistant and susceptible maize hybrids (Pride K127 and Pioneer 3953) and inbreds (CO272 and CO266) were inoculated at intervals from 0 to 18 days after silk emergence by injecting a macroconidial suspension into the silk channel. Five inbreds (CO272, CO266, F7, F2, and A641) were inoculated at three stages of silk development using two techniques: injection into the silk channel and spraying onto exposed silks. At harvest, the severity of ear rot symptoms was assessed on a seven-class rating scale. In an additional experiment, silk tissue sampled from within the silk channel and from the exposed silk of the inbreds at three stages of silk development was examined in vitro for resistance to degradation by F. graminearum. Susceptibility increased immediately after silk emergence, then declined. The best differentiation among genotypes was obtained when inoculation involved injection into the silk channel at an intermediate stage of silk development. When maize ears were inoculated later than 7 days after silk emergence, it was not possible to detect differential resistance of genotypes. Fungal degradation of detached silk tissue also decreased as silk aged. Decreases in silk channel length and in water content of exposed silk as silk ages may partially account for changes in resistance observed over time within individual inbreds. The results of these experiments indicate that when silk inoculation is used to screen for resistance to F. graminearum, all plants should be inoculated at the same stage of development, preferably at the stage when the silk has elongated, has been pollinated, and may have some brown tips.

Precise timing of ear inoculations with U. maydis relative to silk maturity and pollination may improve the ability to screen maize germ plasm for resistance. The objectives of this study were to determine the length of time maize kernels can be infected by U. maydis through silks, and to examine the effects of pollination on infection through silks. Two field studies were done in 1995, 1996, and 1997 at the University of Illinois South Farms. In the date-of-inoculation study, ears were inoculated at 2- to 3-day intervals from early silk emergence until 16 days after silk emergence. In the date-of-planting study, hybrids were planted on four dates and ears were inoculated on the same day for all planting dates. In each study, ear shoots were covered with shoot bags prior to silk emergence to prevent pollination, or ear shoots were left uncovered to allow silks to be pollinated normally. Maize ears were susceptible to infection by U. maydis from silk emergence until 8 to 14 days after silk emergence. During this period of susceptibility, incidence of ears with galls decreased as silks aged. Incidence of ears with galls on plants inoculated 7 days apart differed by as much as 70%. The period that maize ears were susceptible to infection by Li. maydis was shorter and incidence of ears with galls decreased more rapidly when silks were exposed to pollen than when silks were not exposed. The silk channel method of inoculating for common smut does not appear to be practical for large-scale evaluations of numerous lines. The method is practical for evaluating a limited number of lines or for inducing ear galls for commercial production of huitlacoche (smut galls eaten at an immature stage).

A range of different laboratory assays in regard to potential plant growth promotion was performed and strains were further evaluated for improving growth of five maize cultivars under axenic and natural soil conditions. Endophytic colonization was an additional component in our selection process as it is of high importance for an inoculant strain to efficiently colonize the plant environment. All strains had the potential to improve maize seedling growth under axenic conditions. Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed both the highest growth-promoting activity under axenic conditions as well as colonization capacity. FD17 was therefore selected for further plant tests in a net house, in which two different maize cultivars were grown in large pots until ripening and subjected to outdoor climatic conditions. Results showed that inoculation significantly increased plant biomass, number of leaves plant(-1), leaf area, and grain yield up to 39 %, 14 %, 20 %, and 42 %, respectively, as compared to the un-inoculated control. Similarly, inoculation also improved the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) of maize plant and reduced the time needed for flowering. We also confirmed that strain FD17 is able to colonize the rhizosphere, roots and stems. Based on rigorous testing, Enterobacter sp. strain FD17 showed the highest potential to promote growth and health of maize grown under natural conditions. This study suggested that in vitro plant growth-promoting traits and potential of maize seedling growth promotion by bacterial endophytes could be used for the selection of potential inoculant strains subjected for further testing as bio-inoculant under field conditions.

Here, we conduct a comprehensive study to investigate the vertical distribution of AMF in a calcareous field and their temporal structure in maize-roots with fertilizer P application over a three-year period. The results showed that soil available-P response to P fertilization but maize yields did not. Phosphorus fertilization had no-significant effect on richness of AMF except at greater soil-depths. High P-supply reduced root colonization while optimum-P tended to increase colonization and fungal richness on all sampling occasions. Crop phenology might override P-supply in determining the community composition of active root inhabiting fungi. Significant differences in the community structure of soil AMF were observed between the controls and P treatments in surface soil and the community shift was attributable mainly to available-P, N/P and pH. Vertical distribution was related mainly to soil electrical conductivity and Na content. Our results indicate that the structure of AMF community assemblages is correlated with P fertilization, soil depth and crop phenology. Importantly, phosphorus management must be integrated with other agricultural-practices to ensure the sustainability of agricultural production in salinized soils.

We investigated this process using populations of teosinte, a wild annual grass related to maize (Zea mays ssp. mexicana), sampling plants from 10 sites along an elevational gradient as well as rhizosphere biota from three of those sites. We grew half-sibling teosinte families in each biota to test whether trait divergence among teosinte populations reflects adaptation or drift, and whether rhizosphere biota affect expression of diverged traits. We further assayed the influence of rhizosphere biota on contemporary additive genetic variation. We found that adaptation across environment shaped divergence of some traits, particularly flowering time and root biomass. We also observed that different rhizosphere biota shifted expressed values of these traits within teosinte populations and families and altered within-population genetic variance and covariance. In sum, our results imply that changes in trait expression and covariance elicited by rhizosphere communities could have played a historical role in teosinte adaptation to environments and that they are likely to play a role in the response to future selection.

However, this bacterium presents passive penetration in the plant, what makes it possible to inoculate the crops using other methods. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of A. brasilense inoculation methods on the emergence and initial growth of corn and sorghum, under greenhouse conditions. A randomized block design, with four replications, in a 4 x 2 factorial scheme, was used. The first factor consisted of a control treatment (without inoculation) and three inoculation methods: via seed, via sowing furrow and via leaf spray. The second factor was composed by two hybrids of corn and two of sorghum. The application of A. brasilense to the seed can reduce the emergence percentage and the emergence speed index of corn seedlings, depending on the genotype, but its application does not influence the initial growth of the plants. The A. brasilense inoculation via seed and via sowing furrow can reduce the emergence and increase the mean emergence time of sorghum seedlings, depending on the genotype. The A. brasilense inoculation via seed results in an increase in the dry mass of the root system of sorghum plants.

Therefore, seasonal fluctuations in carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) production from roots and root-associated soil may be related to resource partitioning by the crop. Greenhouse studies used C-13 and N-15 stable isotopes to evaluate the carbon (C) partitioning and nitrogen (N) uptake by corn and soybean. We also measured the CO2 and N2O production from planted pots as affected by crop phenology and N fertilization. Specific root-derived respiration was related to the C-13 allocated to roots and was greatest during early vegetative growth. Root-derived respiration and rhizodeposition were greater for corn than soybean. The N-15 uptake by corn increased between vegetative growth, tasseling and milk stages, but the N-15 content in soybean was not affected by phenology. A peak in N2O production was observed with corn at the milk stage, suggesting that the corn rhizosphere supported microbial communities that produced N2O. Most of the N-15-NO3 applied to soybean was not taken up by the plant and negative N2O production during vegetative growth and floral initiation stages suggests that soybean roots supported the reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N-2). We conclude that crop phenology and soil N availability exert important controls on rhizosphere processes, leading to temporal variation in CO2 and N2O production.

Plant emergence was followed, together with bacterial rhizosphere colonization, antibiotic production and effects on fungal growth. P. fluorescens DR54 inoculation of the P. ultimum-challenged seeds improved plant emergence after 7 days compared to a control without the biocontrol strain. At this time, P. fluorescens DR54 was the dominating colony-forming pseudomonad in rhizosphere soil samples from inoculated seedlings as shown by immune-staining with a strain specific antibody. Viscosinamide, a cyclic lipopeptide, which has previously been identified as a major antagonistic determinant produced by P. fluorescens DR54 and shown to induce physiological changes in P. ultimum in vitro, could be detected in the rhizosphere samples. The impact of P. fluorescens DR54 on the growth and activity of P. ultimum was studied by direct microscopy after staining with the vital fluorescent dyes Calcofluor white and fluorescein diacetate. P. fluorescens DR54 caused reduction in P. ultimum mycelial density, oospore formation and intracellular activity. Further, Pythium oospore formation was absent in the presence of P. fluorescens DR54. A striking effect on zoospore forming indigenous Fungi was also observed in microcosms with P. fluorescens DR54 and, thus, where viscosinamide could be detected; a large number of encysted zoospores were seen in such microcosms both with and without P. ultimum infections. In vitro studies confirmed that purified viscosinamide induced encystment of Pythium zoospores. (C) 2000 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

On the other hand, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can reduce damage caused by specific soil-borne plant pathogens and improve drought resistance of pepper. Therefore, one objective of this research was to assess if AMF can modify the development of Verticillium-wilt in pepper plants. A second objective was to study the influence of plant phenology at the moment when V. dahliae was inoculated on the possible biocontrol of the disease by AMF. Results suggested that AMF reduce the deleterious effect of V. dahliae on pepper growth and yield. However, bioprotection against Verticillium-wilt was conditioned by plant phenology at the moment of pathogen attack. The highest efficacy of AMF occurred when V. dahliae was inoculated during the vegetative stage of plants. AMF allowed leaf relative water content to be maintained for longer and delayed both the appearance of disease symptoms and the decrease of photosynthesis in Verticillium-inoculated plants. These benefits on plant physiology increased pepper yield.

These plants expressed a viral coat protein (CP) gene that confers resistance to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). For comparison, we included a non-transgenic parental cultivar (wild type) and another non-transgenic commercial variety. Soil samples were collected at the time of flowering (June) and twice during the fruit-ripening stage (August and September). The microbial community was characterized by analyzing levels of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) as well as the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of bacterial 16S-rRNA and the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Although the amounts of PLFAs and their diversity indices did not differ among pepper lines, they did vary significantly over the growing season. We also used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) to evaluate microbial assemblages from these plants. Overall, no differences were found among pepper lines. However, a significant difference was found between wild type and transgenic peppers, with regard to their bacterial composition based on the T-RFLP profile from HhaI digest. We conclude that the impact of CMV-resistant transgenic pepper on soil microbial assemblages is weak and minor, compared with the dominating natural variations associated with plant growth stages.

The strain readily formed arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) with the roots of strawberry 'Zoji' (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. CV.) when plants were inoculated with either fresh cultured hyphae or root/soil mixtures. Fresh hyphae, however, resulted in higher amounts of colonization than root/soil inoculum. Compared with uninoculated strawberries, inoculation increased plant dry weight by 31%, as well as nitrogen content (47%), phosphorus content (57%), and photosynthetic rate (71%). AM inoculation also shortened the blossom and ripening date by 3 and 4 days, respectively. This is the first report of a P. pinophilum strain resulting in mycorrhiza with strawberry roots. The significant advantages of this strain are that it is easy to culture and inoculation of plants results in significant growth benefits that may be useful in strawberry production.

Strawberry (cv. Calypso) rolC lines were produced by genetic transformation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Yield and fruit quality of the control and transgenic lines were measured under open-field conditions. The effects of the transgenic rolC lines depended on gene copy number: rolC lines with one (Line A) or two gene (Line B) copies showed 30% greater yields than controls, due to 20% more fruit per plant and an increased fruit weight. Line A also differed in terms of the highest fruit quality, due to 10.5% increased soluble solids and 12.7% higher acidity. Moreover, cv. Calypso rolC lines A and B had increased tolerance to greenhouse infection by Phytophthora cactorum. Conversely, for all of these characters, Line F (five rolC copies) was not significantly different from the control line. The same lines were also used to examine their symbiosis with root arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) using vital and non-vital staining of roots collected at different stages of plant growth. Control and rolC plants showed similar intensities of AMF infection according to plant phenology and/or physiology. Furthermore, possible horizontal gene transfer of the rolC gene was tested for the AMF spores by PCR, with all AMF samples negative using rolC primers. The use of the rolC gene should be considered for the improvements provided in productivity, fruit quality and disease resistance of cultivated strawberry that show no effects on soil microorganisms.

Five Salmonella serotypes were used to inoculate tomato plants before and after fruits set, either by injecting stems with inoculum or brushing flowers with it. Ripe tomato fruits were subjected to microbiological analysis. Peptone wash water, homogenates of stem scar tissues, and homogenates of fruit pulp were serially diluted and plated on bismuth sulfite agar before and after enrichment. Presumptive Salmonella colonies were confirmed by serological tests, PCR assay using HILA2 primers, and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus PCR. Of 30 tomatoes harvested from inoculated plants, 11 (37%) were positive for Salmonella. Of the Salmonella-positive tomatoes, 43 and 40%, respectively, were from plants receiving stem inoculation before and after flower set. Two of eight tomatoes produced from inoculated flowers contained Salmonella. Higher percentages of surface (82%) and stem scar tissue (73%) samples, compared to pulp of Salmonella-positive tomatoes (55%), harbored the pathogen. Of the five serotypes in the inoculum, Montevideo was the most persistent, being isolated from tomatoes 49 days after inoculation, and Poona was the most dominant, being present in 5 of 11 Salmonella-positive tomatoes. Results suggest that Salmonella cells survive in or on tomato fruits from the time of inoculation at flowering through fruit ripening. Tomato stems and flowers are possible sites at which Salmonella may attach and remain viable during fruit development, thus serving as routes or reservoirs for contaminating ripened fruit.

As inoculation age (measured in days after plant emergence) increased, percent tuber infection decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in each cultivar. As inoculation pressure (measured by viruliferous aphid-days) increased, percent tuber infection per plant increased significantly for Russet Burbank and Cascade. The percentage of PLRV-infected tubers for any inoculation age and aphid-day treatment combination was always less for Kennebec and Cascade than for Russet Burbank. In each cultivar, there was no significant difference in percent PLRV infection among four size categories of tubers. A greenhouse bioassay classified potato cultivars into PLRV resistance categories corresponding to previously reported field resistance. However, Cascade was not as resistant in the greenhouse bioassay as it was in field trials.

However, to date little is known about the actual ecological processes shaping community composition, complicating attempts to steer microbiome functionality. Here, we assess the development of microbial life history and community-level species interaction patterns that emerge during plant development. We use microbial phenotyping to experimentally test the development of niche complementarity and life history traits linked to microbiome performance. We show that the rhizosphere microbiome assembles from pioneer assemblages of species with random resource overlap into high-density, functionally complementary climax communities at later stages. During plant growth, fast-growing species were further replaced by antagonistic and stress-tolerant ones. Using synthetic consortia isolated from different plant growth stages, we demonstrate that the high functional diversity of 'climax' microbiomes leads to a better resistance to bacterial pathogen invasion. By demonstrating that different life-history strategies prevail at different plant growth stages and that community-level processes may supersede the importance of single species, we provide a new toolbox to understand microbiome assembly and steer its functionality at a community level.

Cultivation-based studies were undertaken on two tomato cultivars Arka Vikas and Arka Abha employing surface sterilized seeds, aseptically germinated seeds and in vitro grown seedlings at different stages. Bacillus sp. appeared primarily as seed externally-associated bacteria. Tissue homogenate from extensively surface-sterilized seeds, day-3 germinating seeds, or 10-day in vitro seedlings did not show any cultivable bacteria on two bacteriological media. Indexing of 4-week old healthy seedlings with seed-coat removal following seed germination showed bacterial association in 50-75% seedlings yielding 10(6)-10(7) cfu g(-1) tissues. Four endophytic bacteria appeared common to both cultivars (Kosakonia, Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Sphingobium spp.) with three additional species in Arka Abha. The bacterial strains showed a manifold increase in growth with host-tissue-extract supplementation. Seed inoculations with single-isolates stimulated germination or enhanced the seedling growth coupled with the activation of additional endophytic bacteria. In vitro seedlings upon recurrent medium-indexing over eight weeks showed gradual emergence of endophytic bacteria. The study reveals the seed internal colonization by different bacterial endophytes in a cultivation-recalcitrant form, their activation to cultivable state during seedling growth and transmission to seedlings with mutualistic effects.

The availability of tomato ripening mutants has revealed many aspects of the genetics behind fleshy fruit ripening, plant hormones and light signal reception. Since previous analyses revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis influences tomato berry ripening, we wanted to test the hypothesis that an interplay might occur between root symbiosis and fruit ripening. With this aim, we screened seven tomato mutants affected in the ripening process for their responsiveness to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Funneliformis mosseae. Following their phenological responses we selected two mutants for a deeper analysis: Green ripe (Gr), deficient in fruit ethylene perception and high-pigment-1 (hp-1), displaying enhanced light signal perception throughout the plant. We investigated the putative interactions between ripening processes, mycorrhizal establishment and systemic effects using biochemical and gene expression tools. Our experiments showed that both mutants, notwithstanding a normal mycorrhizal phenotype at root level, exhibit altered arbuscule functionality. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type, mycorrhization did not lead to a higher phosphate concentration in berries of both mutants. These results suggest that the mutations considered interfere with arbuscular mycorrhiza inducing systemic changes in plant phenology and fruits metabolism. We hypothesize a cross talk mechanism between AM and ripening processes that involves genes related to ethylene and light signaling.

The dynamics of AM fungi with desert ephemerals were examined to determine the effects of host plant life stages on the development of AM fungi. Mean colonization of ephemeral annual plants was 45% lower than that of ephemeral perennial plants. The colonizations were much higher in the early part of the growing season than in later parts, peaking at flowering times. The phenology of AM fungi in root systems varied among different ephemerals. The density of AM fungal spores increased with the development of ephemeral annual plants, reached its maximum at flowering times, and then plateaued about 20 days after the aboveground senescence. A significant positive correlation was found between AM fungi spore density and biomass of ephemeral annual plants. The life cycles of AM fungi associated with desert ephemerals were very short, being about 60-70 days. Soil temperature and water content had no direct influence on the development of AM fungal spores. We concluded that the development of AM fungi was in response to desert ephemeral phenology and life history strategy.

Microbial mitigation-exacerbation continuum: a novel framework for microbiome effects on hosts in the face of stress	ECOLOGY			English	Article						allelopathy; habitat specialization; microbial mitigation; microbiome; plant-soil feedbacks; rosemary scrub; species distributions; stress gradient hypothesis	CERATIOLA-ERICOIDES EMPETRACEAE; GRADIENT HYPOTHESIS; PLANT; COMPETITION; FACILITATION; MICROORGANISMS; COMMUNITIES; GERMINATION; BENEFITS; FEEDBACK	A key challenge to understanding microbiomes and their role in ecological processes is contextualizing their effects on host organisms, particularly when faced with environmental stress. One influential theory, the Stress Gradient Hypothesis, might predict that the frequency of positive interactions increases with stressful conditions such that microbial taxa would mitigate harmful effects on host performance. Yet, equally plausible is that microbial taxa could exacerbate these effects. Here, we introduce the Mitigation-Exacerbation Continuum as a novel framework to conceptualize microbial mediation of stress. We (1) use this continuum to quantify microbial mediation of stress for six plant species and (2) test the association between these continuum values and natural species' abundance. We factorially manipulated a common stress (allelopathy) and the presence of soil microbes to quantify microbial effects in benign and stressed environments for two critical early life-history metrics, seed germination and seedling biomass. Although we found evidence of both mitigation and exacerbation among the six species, exacerbation was more common. Across species, the degree of microbial-mediated effects on germination explained >80% of the variation of natural field abundances. Our results suggest a critical role of soil microbes in mediating plant stress responses, and a potential microbial mechanism underlying species abundance.

Soil microbes play an important role in promoting native establishment and are often added to restoration sites during seed sowing. We tested the role of soil-and lab-grown bacterial inoculants on germination timing and percent germination for 19 species of plants commonly found in coastal California. Each species exhibited a different response to the inoculant treatments, but overall time-to-germination was longer and percent germination was lower with the soil inoculant compared with the control or other treatments. The invasive species in our study had the highest percent germination of all species and germinated faster than all native shrubs. Germination timing was negatively correlated with percent germination and with seed mass. Our results suggest that lab-grown inoculant and chemical treatment are effective at increasing germination in some native species, whereas soil inoculant is not. Given differences in germination timing between native and invasive species, restoration practitioners could consider using herbicide to treat areas seeded with native shrubs immediately following germination of invasive species without harming most natives, although germination timing and herbicides need further study in relation to microbial effects on seed germination.

This led to the hypothesis that cool-season grasses are less dependent on the symbiosis, because the growth of these plants occurs when mycorrhizal fungi are inactive. Field studies were performed to assess the effect of phenology of cool- and warm-season grasses on mycorrhizal fungal activity and fungal species composition. Mycorrhizal fungal activity in field samples was assessed using the vital stain nitro blue tetrazolium in addition to traditional staining techniques. Mycorrhizal activity was greater in cool-season grasses than in warm-season grasses early (April and May) and late (December) in the growing season, while mycorrhizal activity in roots of the warm-season grasses was greater (compared with cool-season grasses) in midseason (July and August). Active mycorrhizal colonization was relatively high in both groups of grasses late in the growing season, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi may proliferate internally or may be parasitic at this time. Total Glomales sporulation was generally greater in the rhizosphere of cool-season grasses in June and in the rhizosphere of the warm-season grasses in October. A growth chamber experiment was conducted to examine the effect of temperature on mycorrhizal dependence of cool- and warm-season grasses. For both groups of grasses, mycorrhizal dependence was greatest at the temperature that favored growth of the host. The results suggest that mycorrhizal fungi are active in roots when cool-season grasses are growing and that cool-season grasses may receive benefit from the symbiosis under relatively cool temperature regimes.

Although natural communities of AM fungi are diverse, we have a poor understanding of the mechanisms that promote and maintain that diversity. Plants may coexist by inhabiting disparate temporal niches; plants of many grasslands are either warm or cool season specialists. We hypothesized that AM fungi might be similarly seasonal. To test our hypothesis, we tracked the sporulation of individual AM fungal species growing within a North Carolina grassland. Data were collected in 1996 and 1997; in 1997, sampling focused on two common species. We found that AM fungi, especially Acaulospora colossica and Gigaspora gigantea, maintained different and contrasting seasonalities. Acaulospora colossica sporulated more frequently in the warm season, but Gi. gigantea sporulated more frequently in the cool season. Moreover, AM fungal species were spatially aggregated at a fine scale. Contrasting seasonal and spatial niches may facilitate the maintenance of a diverse community of AM fungi. Furthermore, these data may illuminate our understanding of the AM fungal influence on plant communities: various fungal species may preferentially associate with different plant species and thereby promote diversity in the plant community.

Two endophytic strains were selected as inocula for the pot experiment: Pseudomonas sp. ISE-12 (B1) and Xanthomonadales sp. CSE-34 (B2). Surface-sterilised seeds were incubated in the bacterial inoculation suspensions before sowing and cultivated in a sterile mixture of sand and vermiculite (1:1). Six salinity treatments were taken into account: 0, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300mM NaCl. Inoculation of seeds with B1 and B2 positively affected germination percentage and germination index and shortened mean germination time, which led to a quickening of the growth stages of seedlings. After 42days inoculated plants had, in general, a greater root length, higher dry biomass, lower tissue water content and lower specific leaf area compared with the control. While the positive effect of B2 bacteria was visible only at low salinity, strain B1 stimulated plant growth at higher salinities (200 and 300mM NaCl). We suggest that the superior growth promotion observed for B1 may be related to the higher metabolic activity of these bacteria.

Semipermanent study regions were set up in each of five vegetation zones along a continuous salinity gradient. Roots of Hordeum jubatum, Distichlis stricta, Agropyron trachycaulum, Sonchus arvensis, Spartina gracilis, and other species were collected from the study regions over six time periods: April, June, July, August, and October of 1991, and May of 1992. These roots were used to quantify mycorrhizal colonization, as well as arbuscule and vesicle formation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were prevalent in the three vegetation zones with lowest soil salinity, with >40% of the observed root pieces colonized. Colonization was <2% in the other two zones, where soil salinity was consistently greater throughout the growing season. The only common pattern in the phenology of mycorrhizal activity was a low level of activity in the early spring. Mycorrhizal activity in most plant species occurred at high levels throughout the summer and fall. Differences in patterns of activity appeared to be linked to differences in phenology of root growth, and not to edaphic differences among vegetation zones.

Four different maternal sibships of Silene latifolia showed no difference in susceptibility to disease by the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum after inoculation of an infectious mixture containing haploid sporidia of both mating types into the growing rosette. Three different combinations of sporidia were used. Two selfing combinations, one using fungus collected from the same population as the host plants, one from a second population, and one cross between strains from the two populations were generated. The three sporidia combinations did not differ in their success in infecting the host plant and sporulating in the flowers. However, this fungal disease altered host plant phenotype in several important ways. Disease retarded flowering in those male plants that initiated flowering in their first season, and it increased the number of flowers produced by both male and female plants. Different fungal strains differentially augmented Bower production, indicating that there is genetic variability for important fitness-related life-history traits in natural populations of the fungus M. violaceum in Europe. Furthermore, in this short-lived perennial host plant, diseased plants were more likely than were healthy ones to initiate flowering in their first growing season. Since this shift from vegetative growth to reproduction should enhance fungal reproductive success, we interpret this as a manipulation of the host plant phenotype by the fungus. In addition we found a significantly female-biased sex ratio across the four maternal sibships in this study and higher infection rates for female plants than males.

Male plants produce many short-lived flowers, whereas females produce few flowers that remain connected with the plant after fertilization. We investigated how variation in flower production and flower longevity affects the infection risk for males and females. 3 In glasshouse experiments, we varied the number of flowers inoculated (4 vs. 16 per plant) with spores and the time until these flowers were removed(1 or 2 days for both sexes, 14 days for females only). We also measured the longevity of male flowers receiving simulated visits, with or without spores, to test for an abscission response to visitation and/or contamination. In a field survey, we measured male and female disease prevalence in 17 natural populations. 4 Varying the number of inoculated flowers did not affect infection probability, but females retaining inoculated flowers for 14 days became diseased more often (20.0%) than did plants with flowers removed within 2 days (7.3%). 5 Males that had dropped more inoculated flowers prematurely were more likely to remain uninfected. Spore-bearing visits shortened male flower longevity (38.4 +/- 2.8 h) relative to non-spore visits (47.9 +/- 5.2 h). 6 Female field disease prevalence (19.7 +/- 3.5%) was higher than that of males (14.3 +/- 2.6%), especially in populations with a high disease incidence. 7 Continuing physical connection during fruit ripening appears to increase invasion time and thus the per-contact infection risk in females. This is consistent with higher female field prevalences, although other explanations, unrelated to disease transmission, are possible. These results illustrate how interactions between plant reproductive behaviour and pollinator activity may affect disease spread. Female mating behaviour may evolve towards lower attractiveness to pollinators to minimize infectious contacts, while males can afford to be more promiscuous with an attractive, but disposable, floral display.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can influence all components of plant reproduction including pollen delivery, pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fertilization, and seed germination. AM fungi associate with plant roots, uptake nutrients, and prime plants for faster defense responses. Our literature review first identified four testable hypotheses describing how AM fungi could alter pollen delivery: (1) We hypothesize AM fungi promote floral display size. The influence of AM fungi on flower size and number is supported by literature, however there are no studies on floral color. (2) We hypothesize AM fungi promote pollen and nectar quality and quantity, and, as reported before, AM fungi promote male fitness over female fitness. (3) We hypothesize AM fungi promote both earlier and longer flowering times, but we found no consistent trend in the data for earlier or later or longer flowering times. (4) We hypothesize AM fungi alter floral secondary chemistry and VOCs, and find there is clear evidence for the alteration of floral chemistry but little data on VOCs. Second, we focus on how AM fungi could alter pollen germination, pollen tube growth, and fertilization, and present three testable hypotheses. We found evidence that AM fungi influence pollen germination and pollen tube growth, production of seeds, and seed germination. However, while most of these influences are positive they are not conclusive, because studies have been conducted in small numbers of systems and groups. Therefore, we conclude that the majority of research to date may not be measuring the influence of AM fungi on the most important components of plant reproduction: pollen germination, pollen tube growth, fertilization, and seed germination.

Effects of climate change on fungal distribution and activity are hard to predict because they are mediated in many different ways, including: fungal physiology, reproduction and survival, host physiology, spatial and temporal distribution of hosts, resource availability and competition. Currently it is hard to monitor such effects on fungal mycelium in the field, but fruit bodies provide a useful surrogate. Here we review the effects of climate change on phenological changes in fungal fruiting and fruit body yield, and on fungal hosts and distribution, particularly of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes. We report that fruiting phenology is changing in many European countries: on average, the fruiting season is extending, though for some species it is contracting; different species and ecological groups behave differently; time of fruiting depends on geographical location; some fungi now fruit early in the year as well as in autumn, and spring fruiting is getting earlier; some fungi appear to be changing hosts; fruit body yields vary dramatically from year to year; the amount, duration and frequency of fruiting are influenced by numerous environmental factors. We also consider difficulties in assessing phenological and distributional data, and provide suggestions for future research directions at the interface of laboratory experiments and field observations, including molecular approaches and monitoring systems.

However, little is known about the difference in phenology and environmental drivers of mushroom fruiting between functional guilds, e.g., ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mutualists and saprotrophs (SAP). There is a remarkable difference between ECM and SAP fungi in their available carbon sources and lifecycles, and thus these fungal groups are likely to differ in fruiting phenology. We analyzed intra-and inter-annual phenological patterns of mushroom fruiting throughout the year using a long-term census dataset of mushroom-forming fungi in a Japanese oak forest in which a total of 11,923 mushroom counts (668 species) were recorded during monthly intervals from 1982 to 2011. ECM fungi showed a unimodal seasonal fruiting peak from mid-summer to early autumn; litter-decomposing fungi showed moderate fruiting peaks from early summer or early autumn, and the phenology of wood-decomposing fungi varied considerably among the genera. Each functional group was controlled by a different set of external factors; temperature and rainfall increased ECM fungal fruiting, but key factors substantially differed among the genera of litter-and wood-decomposing fungi in taxon-specific ways. Our results suggest that fungal fruiting phenology may be affected by the seasonality of carbohydrate availability. The highly scheduled reproduction of ECM fungi may reflect temperature-dependent increases and drought-induced decreases of photosynthetic activity in host plants rather than improved growth conditions for fungi during the summer. We argue that the way a fungus obtains carbohydrates may explain a substantial fraction of the fruiting phenology, which may make a differential contribution to the community structure of fungus-associated organisms and terrestrial biomass turnover based on fungal functional groups.

The interactions between plant life form and fungal traits of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi determine the symbiotic community	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Life history traits; Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism; Symbiosis assembly; Mediterranean environments; Functional diversity	SOIL DISTURBANCE; T-RFLP; DIVERSITY; ROOTS; REVEALS; HISTORY; SCALE; COLONIZATION; PRODUCTIVITY; BIODIVERSITY	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have traditionally been considered generalist symbionts. However, an increasing number of studies are pointing out the selectivity potential of plant hosts. Plant life form, determined by plant life history traits, seems to drive the AM fungal community composition. The AM fungi also exhibit a wide diversity of functional traits known to be responsible for their distribution in natural ecosystems. However, little is known about the role of plant and fungal traits driving the resultant symbiotic assemblages. With the aim of testing the feedback relationship between plant and fungal traits on the resulting AM fungal community, we inoculated three different plant life forms, i.e. annual herbs, perennial herbs and perennial semi-woody plants, with AM fungal communities sampled in different seasons. We hypothesized that the annual climate variation will induce changes in the mean traits of the AM fungal communities present in the soil throughout the year. Furthermore, the association of plants with different life forms with AM fungi with contrasting life history traits will show certain preferences according to reciprocal traits of the plants and fungi. We found changes in the AM fungal community throughout the year, which were differentially disrupted by disturbance and altered by plant growth form and plant biomass. Both plant and fungal traits clearly contributed to the resultant AM fungal communities. The revealed process can have implications for the functioning of ecosystems since changes in dominant plant life forms or climatic variables could influence the traits of AM fungal communities in soil and hence ecosystem processes.

Annuals were determined to have significantly less AM infection than their perennial counterparts. Additionally, annuals were shown to have significantly smaller fine root diameters than perennials. Within 15 of the 17 species examined, the presence of AM hyphae in a root segment was not a significant determinant of root diameter, indicating than in most plant species mycorrhizal infection is not directly promoting root diameter increases.

Differences in species responses to mycorrhizal colonization can have a significant influence on plant community structure. The growth responses of 36 species of warm- and cool-season tallgrass prairie grasses and 59 tallgrass prairie forbs to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal colonization were assessed in greenhouse studies to examine the extent of interspecific variation in host-plant benefit from the symbiosis and patterns of mycorrhizal dependence among host plant life history (e.g., annual, perennial) and taxonomic (e.g., grass, forb, legume, nonlegume) groups and phenological guilds. There was a strong and significant relationship between phenology of prairie grasses and mycorrhizal responsiveness. however this relationship was less apparent in forbs. Perennial warm-season C-4 grasses and forbs generally benefited significantly from the mycorrhizal symbiosis. whereas biomass production of the cool-season C-3 grasses was not affected. The root systems of the cool-season grasses were also less highly colonized by the AM fungi, as compared to the warm-season grasses or forbs. Unlike the native perennials, annuals were generally not responsive to mycorrhizal colonization and were lower in percentage root colonization than the perennial species. Plant growth responsiveness and AM root colonization were positively correlated for the nonleguminous species, with this relationship being strongest for the cool-season grasses. In contrast, root colonization of prairie legumes showed a significant, but negative, relationship to mycorrhizal growth responsiveness.

One possibility is that closely related plants have more similar AMF communities than more distantly related plants, an indication of phylogenetic host specificity. Here, we investigated the structure of AMF communities among dominant grassland plants at three sites in the Northern Great Plains to test whether the pairwise phylogenetic distance among plant species was correlated with pairwise AMF community dissimilarity. For eight dominant and co-occurring grassland plant species, we reconstructed a phylogeny based on DNA data and characterized the AMF communities of their roots at each site. Community analyses revealed that AMF communities varied among sites and among plant species. Contrary to expectations for phylogenetic host specificity, we found that within a site more closely related plants had more distinct AMF communities despite their having similar phenologies. Associations with unique AMF communities may enhance the functional complementarity of related species and promote their coexistence.

Flowering and stem densities of the cool-season grass, Dichanthelium oligosanthes, sedges (Carex spp.), and the forb Aster ericoides were higher in non-mycorrhizal (benomyl-treated) than in mycorrrhizal plots and the magnitude of these differences was significantly affected by burning. Mycorrhizae significantly enhanced flowering of the warm-season grasses Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans in burned prairie, but not in unburned sites. These patterns suggest that mycorrhizal effects on the dynamics of cool-season graminoid and forb populations are likely to be mediated indirectly through effects of the symbiosis on the competitive dominance of their neighbors. Seedling emergence rates of the cool-season C-3 grasses Elymus canadensis and Koeleria cristata were significantly reduced in the benomyl-treated plots, whereas benomyl treatment had no significant effect on seedling emergence of the warm-season C-4 grasses A. gerardii and Panicum virgatum. The forbs showed variable responses. Seedling emergence of Liatris aspera was greater under mycorrhizal conditions, but that of Dalea purpurea was unaffected by mycorrhizal treatment. These results show that effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis on the population dynamics of co-occurring prairie plants vary significantly both among species and among different life history stages within species. The results also indicate that mycorrhizas and fire interact to influence competitive interactions and demographic patterns of tallgrass prairie plant populations.

In order to understand the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on growth of ephemerals, a pot experiment was conducted in greenhouse conditions. Two desert ephemerals, Erodium oxyrrhynchum and Plantago minuta, were tested for their response to inoculation with two AM fungi, BEG 167 (Glomus mosseae) and BEG 141 (Glomus intraradices). The results showed that mycorrhizal colonization led to marked improvement in both the reproductive (timing of flowering and number of seeds) and vegetative (dry matter) phase of the two ephemeral plants. Dry weight per plant inoculated with AM fungi was 57 to 67 percent higher than the control in E. oxyrrhynchum and 8 to 11 times higher than the control in P. minuta. Anthesis was advanced by 14 to 17d in P. minuta and 5 to 7d in E. oxyrrhynchum, respectively, when both plants were inoculated with AM fungi. Colonization of mycorrhizal fungi significantly increased the total number of seeds or fruits per plant. Water use efficiency and photosynthetic rates were significantly higher in inoculated E. oxyrrhynchum plants than those of non-inoculated plants. These results indicate that although the two spring ephemerals were able to finish their life cycle without AM fungi, the fungi might greatly enhance survival and population expansion by advancing the timing of flowering and by increasing seed production in the desert environment in the spring.

A few recent studies have documented changes in fungal fruiting in Europe in the last few decades, but the geographic and taxonomic extent of these changes, the mechanisms behind these changes, and their relationships to climate are not well understood. Here, we analyzed herbarium data of 274 species of fungi from Michigan to test the hypotheses that fruiting times of fungi depend on annual climate and that responses depend on taxonomic and functional groups. We show that the fungal community overall fruits later in warmer and drier years, which has led to a shift toward later fruiting dates for autumn-fruiting species, consistent with existing evidence. However, we also show that these effects are highly variable among species and are partly explained by basic life-history characteristics. Resulting differences in climate sensitivities are expected to affect community structure as climate changes. This study provides a unique picture of the climate dependence of fungal phenology in North America and an approach for quantifying how individual species and broader fungal communities will respond to ongoing climate change.

The Snowmelt Niche Differentiates Three Microbial Life Strategies That Influence Soil Nitrogen Availability During and After Winter	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						snowmelt; watershed; life history strategy; soil nitrogen; soil archaea and bacteria; soil fungi	LITTER DECOMPOSITION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEEPENED SNOW; COMMUNITY; DYNAMICS; CARBON; ALPINE; BACTERIAL; SENSITIVITY; RESPONSES	Soil microbial biomass can reach its annual maximum pool size beneath the winter snowpack and is known to decline abruptly following snowmelt in seasonally snow-covered ecosystems. Observed differences in winter versus summer microbial taxonomic composition also suggests that phylogenetically conserved traits may permit winter- versus summer-adapted microorganisms to occupy distinct niches. In this study, we sought to identify archaea, bacteria, and fungi that are associated with the soil microbial bloom overwinter and the subsequent biomass collapse following snowmelt at a high-altitude watershed in central Colorado, United States. Archaea, bacteria, and fungi were categorized into three life strategies (Winter-Adapted, Snowmelt-Specialist, Spring-Adapted) based upon changes in abundance during winter, the snowmelt period, and after snowmelt in spring. We calculated indices of phylogenetic relatedness (archaea and bacteria) or assigned functional attributes (fungi) to organisms within life strategies to infer whether phylogenetically conserved traits differentiate Winter-Adapted, Snowmelt-Specialist, and Spring-Adapted groups. We observed that the soil microbial bloom was correlated in time with a pulse of snowmelt infiltration, which commenced 65 days prior to soils becoming snow-free. A pulse of nitrogen (N, as nitrate) occurred after snowmelt, along with a collapse in the microbial biomass pool size, and an increased abundance of nitrifying archaea and bacteria (e.g., Thaumarchaeota, Nitrospirae). Winter- and Spring-Adapted archaea and bacteria were phylogenetically clustered, suggesting that phylogenetically conserved traits allow Winter- and Spring-Adapted archaea and bacteria to occupy distinct niches. In contrast, Snowmelt-Specialist archaea and bacteria were phylogenetically overdispersed, suggesting that the key mechanism(s) of the microbial biomass crash are likely to be density-dependent (e.g., trophic interactions, competitive exclusion) and affect organisms across a broad phylogenetic spectrum. Saprotrophic fungi were the dominant functional group across fungal life strategies, however, ectomycorrhizal fungi experienced a large increase in abundance in spring. If well-coupled plant-mycorrhizal phenology currently buffers ecosystem N losses in spring, then changes in snowmelt timing may alter ecosystem N retention potential. Overall, we observed that snowmelt separates three distinct soil niches that are occupied by ecologically distinct groups of microorganisms. This ecological differentiation is of biogeochemical importance, particularly with respect to the mobilization of nitrogen during winter, before and after snowmelt.

Understanding how spatially discrete microbial communities change across years and seasons in response to environmental factors, plant phenology and aggregate turnover, is key to understanding how varying management practices impact the ecology of soil microbial communities. We investigated both seasonal (within year) and annual (across sampling years) changes of discrete microbial communities in soil aggregate fractions, large macroaggregates (LM) and microaggregates (MICRO) in three different bioenergy management systems. We hypothesized that 1) seasonal changes due to plant phenology and aggregate turnover will be most pronounced within the MICRO aggregate soil microbial community; 2) inter-annual variability will lead to changes in microbial diversity across aggregate sizes and the magnitude of change will be mediated by management regime. We found that LM and MICRO aggregates have unique microbial communities within soil. MICRO aggregate microbial communities are more diverse and change more dynamically across the sampling season, peaking in diversity at peak plant growth and maximum biomass. The number of families indicative of specific MICRO aggregate habitats increases over the growing season for both bacteria (from 3 to 51) and fungi (from 8 to 14). The LM aggregates harbored less diverse, yet more stable, communities within a growing season. By contrast, between years the LM aggregates were the most responsive to inter-annual variability. Our study demonstrates the importance of including the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil microbes. We identified hot spots of microbial diversity within soil, with a greater diversity of microbes found under prairies, within the MICRO aggregates, and seasonally during peak plant biomass. Targeted analysis of the MICRO aggregates can contribute to deeper understanding of potential diversity and functioning of soil microbial communities for ecosystem maintenance as well as the response to climatic events and environmental change.

Shoots of inoculated plants emerged 7-13 d earlier than those of non-inoculated plants. Inoculation slightly delayed the emergence of flower buds on WRL and PFL, but did not delay the time of flower opening of WRL. Inoculated YZL flowered 4-11 d earlier than non-inoculated plants. The number of flowers produced by YZL was consistently increased by inoculation, while the inoculation with VAMF increased flower production by WRL and PFL only when plants were growing in pasteurized soil. Leaf biomass of inoculated WRL was larger than non-inoculated plants, while leaf biomass was generally smaller in inoculated PFL and YZL. Partitioning of biomass to bulbs and offsets varied with species, soil pasteurization, and inoculation. Inoculation increased the combined weight of bulbs and offsets at the end of the second growing cycle by 50-150%. Inoculated YZL and WRL consistently produced more offsets in the second growing season after inoculation. For all species, inoculation increased phosphorus and carbohydrates and decreased nitrogen and amino acids in bulbs. Adding VAMF into the growing medium of Zephyranthes altered aspects of plant development and biomass partitioning important to flower and bulb production during the first growing cycle after inoculation, and most effects of VAMF inoculation are more pronounced in the second growing cycle after inoculation. Of the three species examined, Z. sulphurea showed the most consistent responses to inoculation.

The method can be used to determine the species of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that sporulate on the roots of plants in nature, and can also be used to examine the phenology of sporulation in a natural ecosystem. Data are provided from use of the method on sugar maple seedlings recovered from two deciduous forests, one near St. Hippolyte, Quebec, and the other near Waterloo, Ontario. We have shown that, at St. Hippolyte, Glomus aggregatum, G. hoi, G. macrocarpum, and G. rubiforme form associations with sugar maples, and that the sporocarpic Glomus species, G. aggregatum and G. rubiforme, produced spores in the fall, whereas the other two species formed them throughout the growing season. Whereas sporulation was observed on nearly 50% of the plants from the acidic site at St. Hippolyte, no sporulation was observed at the Waterloo site.

The Effects of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Colonisation on Nutrient Status, Growth, Productivity, and Canker Resistance of Apple (Malus pumila)	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; apple canker; biotic resistance; nutrient status; pathogens; root growth; symbiosis; sustainable agriculture	FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; WHEAT CULTIVARS; PHOSPHORUS; RESPONSES; COMMUNITY; CARBON; YIELD; INTENSIFICATION; BIODIVERSITY; INOCULATION	We assess whether arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) improve growth, nutritional status, phenology, flower and fruit production, and disease resistance in woody perennial crops using apple (Malus pumila) as a study system. In a fully factorial experiment, young trees were grown for 3 years with or without AMF (Funneliformis mosseae and Rhizophagus irregularis), and with industrial standard fertiliser applications or restricted fertiliser (10% of standard). We use two commercial scions (Dabinett and Michelin) and rootstocks (MM111 and MM106). Industrial standard fertiliser applications reduced AMF colonisation and root biomass, potentially increasing drought sensitivity. Mycorrhizal status was influenced by above ground genotypes (scion type) but not rootstocks, indicating strong interactions between above and below ground plant tissue. The AMF inoculation significantly increased resistance to Neonectria ditissima, a globally economically significant fungal pathogen of apple orchards, but did not consistently alter leaf nutrients, growth, phenology or fruit and flower production. This study significantly advances understanding of AMF benefits to woody perennial crops, especially increased disease resistance which we show is not due to improved tree nutrition or drought alleviation. Breeding programmes and standard management practises can limit the potential for these benefits.	[Berdeni, Despina; Cotton, T. E.

We report a culture-independent, community-level assessment of apple flower microbial diversity and dynamics. We collected flowers from six apple trees at five time points, starting before flowers opened and ending at petal fall. We applied streptomycin to half of the trees when flowers opened. Assessment of microbial diversity using tag pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that the apple flower communities were rich and diverse and dominated by members of TM7 and Deinococcus-Thermus, phyla about which relatively little is known. From thousands of taxa, we identified six successional groups with coherent dynamics whose abundances peaked at different times before and after bud opening. We designated the groups Pioneer, Early, Mid, Late, Climax, and Generalist communities. The successional pattern was attributed to a set of prevalent taxa that were persistent and gradually changing in abundance. These taxa had significant associations with other community members, as demonstrated with a cooccurrence network based on local similarity analysis. We also detected a set of less-abundant, transient taxa that contributed to general tree-to-tree variability but not to the successional pattern. Communities on trees sprayed with streptomycin had slightly lower phylogenetic diversity than those on unsprayed trees but did not differ in structure or succession. Our results suggest that changes in apple flower microbial community structure are predictable over the life of the flower, providing a basis for ecological understanding and disease management. IMPORTANCE Flowering plants (angiosperms) represent a diverse group of an estimated 400,000 species, and their successful cultivation is essential to agriculture. Yet fundamental knowledge of flower-associated microbiota remains largely unknown. Even less well understood are the changes that flower microbial communities experience through time. Flowers are particularly conducive to comprehensive temporal studies because they are, by nature, ephemeral organs. Here, we present the first culture-independent time series of bacterial and archaeal communities associated with the flowers of apple, an economically important crop. We found unexpected diversity on apple flowers, including a preponderance of taxa affiliated with Deinococcus-Thermus and TM7, phyla that are understudied but thought to be tolerant of an array of environmental stresses. Our results also suggest that changes in microbial community structure on the apple flower may be predictable over the life of the flower, providing the basis for ecological understanding and disease management.

Early events in the life of apple roots: variation in root growth rate is linked to mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal fungal colonization	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Fine root production; Malus domestica; Root-fungal interactions; Soil pathogens	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL; GLOMUS-INTRARADICES; SOIL; INFECTION; RHIZOSPHERE; RESPONSES; PLANTS; GRAPE; TEMPERATURE; PARASITICA	Early events of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal fungal colonization in newly-emerging roots of mature apple (Malus domestica Borkh) trees were characterized to determine the relationship of these events to fine root growth rate and development. New roots were traced on root windows to measure growth and then collected and stained to quantify microscopically the presence of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal fungal structures. Most new roots were colonized by either mycorrhizal or nonmycorrhizal fungi but none less 25 days old were ever internally colonized by both. Compared to nonmycorrhizal colonization, mycorrhizal colonization was associated with faster growing roots and roots that grew for a longer duration, leading to longer roots. While either type of fungi was observed in roots as soon as 3 days after root emergence, intraradical colonization by mycorrhizal fungi was generally faster (peaking at 7 to 15 days) than that by nonmycorrhizal fungi and often occurred more frequently in younger roots. Only 15 to 35% of the roots had no fungal colonization by 30 days after emergence. This study provides the first detailed examination of the early daily events of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal fungal colonization in newly emerging roots under field conditions. We observed marked discrimination of roots between mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal fungi and provide evidence that mycorrhizal fungi may select for faster growing roots and possibly influence the duration of root growth by non-nutritional means.

Here we examined in long-term time-course experiments the bacterial root microbiota of the arctic-alpine perennial Arabis alpina in natural and controlled environments by 16S rRNA gene profiling. We identified soil type and residence time of plants in soil as major determinants explaining up to 15% of root microbiota variation, whereas environmental conditions and host genotype explain maximally 11% of variation. When grown in the same soil, the root microbiota composition of perennial A. alpina is largely similar to those of its annual relatives A. thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta. Non-flowering wild-type A. alpina and flowering pep1 mutant plants assemble an essentially indistinguishable root microbiota, thereby uncoupling flowering time from plant residence time-dependent microbiota changes. This reveals the robustness of the root microbiota against the onset and perpetual flowering of A. alpina. Together with previous studies, this implies a model in which parts of the root microbiota modulate flowering time, whereas, after microbiota acquisition during vegetative growth, the established root-associated bacterial assemblage is structurally robust to perturbations caused by flowering and drastic changes in plant stature.

To investigate the effects of seasonal change of host plant phenology on the bacterial communities in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots, bacterial communities in birch root tips with different ECM fungal species, those of non-mycorrhizal roots and those in bulk soil, were examined over a 15-month period, including two autumn seasons of 2008 and 2009, in field settings. Morphotyping and sequencing to identify the fungal species and RNA-based DGGE, cloning and sequencing were used to characterise the active bacterial communities. The most frequently observed fungus was Leccinum scabrum while other ECM fungi including Hebeloma velutipes, Russula versicolor and unidentified Cortinarius and Tomentella species were commonly found. ECM roots with L. scabrum hosted declining numbers of bacterial sequence types, observed as distinct bands on the DGGE profile, from spring to autumn in 2009. The numbers of sequence types associated with L. scabrum and non-mycorrhizal roots were reduced in autumn 2009 than in autumn 2008, but the numbers associated with other ECM roots and bulk soil were constant over the same period. Roots with L. scabrum harboured unique bacterial communities which were distinct from bulk soils, non-mycorrhizal roots and roots with other ECM fungi in 2008 but the differences were less clear in 2009. The results indicate that the metabolically active bacterial communities in ECM are influenced by fungal species, seasonal host plant phenology and show year to year variation.

To address the hypothesis that pollution from a major highway would influence phylloplane communities, blueberry leaves were collected in Apr., Jun., Aug., and Oct. over 2 years from bushes in wild areas and cultivated farms along transects perpendicular to the Atlantic City Expressway. Community structure and species richness changed monthly, annually, and from site to site. Management practices in cultivated sites accounted for much of the variation in species richness and community composition among sites. Leaf age also influenced the community structure of phylloplane fungal communities. Leaves collected in Apr. had significantly lower species richness than those collected in later months (F = 19.37, P < 0.0001). Yearly differences in species richness and community structure were likely due to differences in meteorological variables. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

Here, we tested separately the effects of four naturally occurring soil microbiomes and their constituent soil chemistries on flowering phenology and reproductive fitness of Boechera stricta, a wild relative of Arabidopsis. Flowering time was sensitive to both microbes and the abiotic properties of different soils; varying soil microbiota also altered patterns of selection on flowering time. Thus, soil microbes potentially contribute to phenotypic plasticity of flowering time and to differential selection observed between habitats. We also describe a method to dissect the microbiome into single axes of variation that can help identify candidate organisms whose abundance in soil correlates with flowering time. This approach is broadly applicable to search for microbial community members that alter biological characteristics of interest.

'Queen Fabiola' was grown with or without arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) inoculum in pasteurized or nonpasteurized soil to determine if inoculation altered flower and corm production. The first growing cycle after planting, mycorrhizal inoculation decreased the days to anthesis and increased the number of flowers produced per inflorescence and flower longevity. It also affected the quality of the daughter corm, which influenced flowering the following year. Inoculated plants produced larger daughter corms and more cormels than uninoculated plants, and allocated more biomass to the corms than the cormels, which lowered the average weight of the cormels. Corms produced by inoculated plants also had higher concentration of nitrogen, potassium, zinc, and nonreducing sugars than those produced by uninoculated plants. The beneficial effects of AMF inoculation on flowering and corm/cormel production were generally increased by soil pasteurization. The results indicate that mycorrhizal inoculation may enhance commercial cut flower and corm production of this crop.

So far, studies of the herbivory-mycorrhiza relationship have not yielded consistent results. This may be related to differences between species of fungi, or the frequency of the herbivory. This study tested the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) species with varying clipping frequency on the phenology and colonization by AMF in the roots of Bromus inermis. The species of AMF significantly affected root and shoot biomass, as well as the degree of mycorrhizal colonization. Clipping frequency also influenced plant biomass and mycorrhizal phenology. High frequency clipping typically had the strongest effect on the variables measured. However, the extent of the clipping effect was dependent on which AMF species were associated with the plant, and which mycorrhizal structure was assessed. For example, intraradical hyphae and arbuscules were negatively affected by clipping, whereas the production of vesicles and spores was stimulated, albeit to different degrees in different AMF species. In contrast, extraradical hyphal length did not respond significantly to clipping. This AMF x clipping interaction indicates that it is difficult to generalize on the effects of herbivory on plant and fungal responses, even when dealing with the same plant species.

Survival analysis to determine the length of the incubation period of Camellia twig blight caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article						dieback; stem blight; stem canker	GLOMERELLA-CINGULATA; ANTHRACNOSE; STRAWBERRY; HISTOPATHOLOGY; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DISPERSAL; SEEDLINGS; ACUTATUM; DIEBACK; DISEASE	Camellia twig blight, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is a disease common to several Camellia species in the southern United States. To determine the potential seasonal differences in incubation periods, stems of Camellia sasanqua 'Rosea' plants grown in pine bark under ambient conditions were wounded and inoculated monthly with C. gloeosporioides mycelium. The time until appearance of the first symptom of disease (incubation period length) was recorded for all stems. Stems that did not display a disease symptom by the last day of the observation period were recorded as censored observations. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier estimates, Cox proportional hazards, and extended Cox models was used to analyze the data. Incubation period length was regressed against stem diameter, monthly mean hours per day in a specified temperature range (15 to 30 degrees C), and a categorical season variable approximating the four host growth stages (winter dormancy, spring leaf and stem growth, summer stem hardening and bud set, fall cessation of leaf and stem growth and opening of flowers) at the time stems were inoculated. Steins of thicker diameter tended to have greater incubation period length, while higher monthly mean hours per day in the specified temperature range decreased incubation period length. In comparison to winter months, spring, summer, and fall months were all associated with significantly higher risks for disease symptom appearance. The median incubation period lengths for the spring, summer, fall, and winter months were 18, 23, 28, and 57 days, respectively.	ARS, USDA, So Hort Lab, Poplarville, MS USA; [Copes, W.

Cardamine concatenata (Brassicaceae) exhibited VAM colonization only during senescence in May, whereas Trillium flexipes and Smilacina racemosa exhibited robust VAM development throughout the year. The lowest mean percent root length colonized (PRLC) for T. flexipes and S. racemosa was 38.3% and 37.7%, respectively, while the greatest was 80.2% and 80.8%, respectively. Overall, analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant seasonal effects with summer months having higher mean PRLC, and winter and early spring months having the lowest. ANOVA also indicated a significant effect due to topography, with uplands and slopes having greater mean PRLC than lowlands. The significantly lower mean PRLC for both T. flexipes and S. racemosa may have reflected higher phosphate availability in the spring, cooler temperatures, and/or moister conditions. The significantly lower mean PRLC in lowland positions may be due to greater soil moisture throughout the year. These results support the hypothesis that VAM development is lower in moister topographic positions, however, they do not support the hypothesis that VAM development would increase with decreasing P availability. Consequently, moisture appeared more important than P in regulating VAM development in these sites.

Baekgwang in response to the different timing of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation were examined. To evaluate the effects of AMF inoculation timing on growth of chrysanthemum cuttings, AMF was directly inoculated to cutting (AMFD), or inoculated at transplanting stage (AMFA). Control plants did not receive AMF inoculation (CON). A significant difference in plant growth was observed in AMF treatment compared to noninoculated treatment at transplanting stage. Rooting rate in AMF treatment was 99% whereas it was 76% in non-mycorrhizal inoculation. The colonization rate was 3.9% in AMF treatment, while it was 0% in non-AMF treatment. Tap root length and number of lateral roots in AMF treatment were twice than those of non-AMF treatment. Inoculation of AMF significantly increased shoot and root growth at transplanting stage. At 7 weeks after transplanting, chrysanthemum plants in AMFD and AMFA treatments had 46.42 and 34.24% colonization rate, respectively. Low colonization rate (6.08%) was observed in CON, possibly due to contamination. Plant height, leaf area, root length, and fresh and dry weight of shoots, stems and,roots in AMF inoculation treatments (AMFD and AMFA) were significantly higher than control plants. AMF-inoculation significantly shortened flowering time compared to non-AMF plants. Chrysanthemum in AMID, AMFA and CON-treatments flowered at 98, 104 and 112 days after transplanting, respectively. Fresh weight, width and height of flowers in AMFD and AMFA treatments were generally higher than those in CON. However, a significant increase in fresh weight, width and height of flowers was found in AMFD treatment. A significant increase of macronutrient uptake in leaves was observed for AMFD treatment, compared with CON. Mn uptake in AMFD and AMFA was more than double than that in CON. In roots, macro and micronutrient concentrations were generally higher in AMFD. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The interactions between a set of environmental and epidemic variables associated with disease expression and 184 different factor combinations were investigated to determine the parameters needed to explain Asiatic citrus canker (ACC) disease expression. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), inoculation date (Id), fruit and leaf age ratings (FAR and LAR), and number of days during the first 2 weeks postinoculation for which the temperature was less than 14degreesC (T-min) or more than 28degreesC (T-max) were retained by principal component analysis and canonical correlation analysis as the most meaningful epidemic and environmental variables, respectively. AUDPC as the strongest dependent variable and combinations of the environmental variables as independent variables were used in multiple regression analyses. Tissue age rating at the time of infection was a good predictor for disease resulting from spray inoculation on fruits and leaves and also on fruits following a wound inoculation. Temperature, as expressed by T-min or T-max, was also a significant factor in determining disease development described by AUDPC. Mature green stems were highly susceptible after wounding, similarly to leaves, but buds and leaf scars expressed the lowest susceptibility. These variations in disease expression according to the tissues will have different impacts on ACC epidemiology.

The aims of this study were to identify the fungal community (endophytic and non-endophytic) associated with C. oblongifolia seeds and to test the effects of these different fungal species on germination. In general, germination of C. oblongifolia seeds was high (about 85 %), initiating four days after sowing and continuing for a total of 20 days. External asepsis with sodium hypochlorite did not influence germinability of C. oblongifolia. Seed infestation with Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, Mucor sp. and Rhizopus stolonifer did not affect the time required for germination, however, infection with A. flavus negatively affected germination percentage. Endophytic fungi were not isolated from C. oblongifolia seeds, suggesting that this species does not transmit endophytic fungi vertically. Therefore, C. oblongifolia can be classified in Class 3 with regard to the transmission and presence of endophytes.

This study investigated seed germination of Crataegus pseudoheterophylla Pojark using different combinations of growth promoting rhizobacteria and stratification regimes. The PGPR treatments were Azotobacter chroococcum 12, Azospirillum lipoferum OF, Pseudomonas fluorescens 169, Bacillus subtilis FzB24 and combinations (co-inoculation) using two or all PGPR inoculants. The control was no inoculation followed by stratification. Temperature regulation in the stratification regime was 1 month at the constant temperature of 23 C, then 3 months at 4 degrees C. The alternate temperature regime was 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C followed by 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks at 23 degrees C, then 1 month at 4 degrees C. The effects of these treatments were evaluated and results showed that treatments of PGPR inoculation stimulated germination in terms of percentage of seed germination, speed of germination and mean germination time, and effect was significant at (p <0.05). Higher percentages of seed germination (18.33%) and speed of germination (4.82 number/day) were recorded for co-inoculated seeds by the combination of all bacterial inoculants and the alternate temperature stratification regime. Results showed a higher percentage of seed germination using alternate temperature stratification than for the constant temperature stratification regime. These results suggest that PGPRs in combination were effective in terms of promoting germination of C pseudoheterophylla seeds. (C) 0 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were extracted from weathered soil (60.7 g of TPH kg(-1) of dry soil) and spiked on perlite at initial concentration of 5 g of TPH kg(-1) of dry perlite. Phenological characteristics, total microbial viable counts, hydrocarbon degraders and residual hydrocarbons were determined through 180 days of culture. Phenological characteristics of inoculated plants were improved as compared with non-inoculated plants: root biomass was 1.6 times greater, flowering time was reduced (13%), and the number of inflorescences was 1.5 times higher. The rhizospheric bacterial and fungi counts were higher for planted treatments (inoculated and not inoculated) than for unplanted pots. The maximum phytoremediation rate (0.51 mg of TPH g(-1) of dry plant d(-1)) for inoculated plants was reached at 60 days of culture, and was two times higher than for non-inoculated plants (55% TPH removal). Similar hydrocarbon phytoremediation extent values for inoculated (90%) and non-inoculated (85%) plants were obtained at 180 days of culture. The present study demonstrated that mutual benefits between C laxus and inoculated hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms are improved during phytoremediation. It is pertinent to note that this is the first report of hydrocarbon phytoremediation by Cyperus laxus Lam., a native plant growing in highly contaminated swamps. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A fungus isolated from roots of C. macranthos var. rebunense induced symbiotic germination of the species in vitro. Cold treatment of the seeds at 4degreesC prior to fungal inoculation was required for the symbiotic germination. Changing the timing of inoculation of the fungus to the seeds greatly improved germination frequency. Maximum germination was attained after seeds were inoculated just after the cold treatment for 12 weeks, and approximately 20% of the seeds developed into protocorms more than 1 mm long. These results suggest that fungal inoculation takes place at the beginning of spring in nature, and the tough impervious seed coat may preserve the seed from the infection during autumn and winter seasons. The lengthy culture period of more than 16 weeks at 20degreesC on the same medium with the fungus caused gradual browning and rot of the protocorms. By elimination of the fungus with a fungicide and by transfer to a nutrient rich medium, approximately 20% of the protocorms developed into healthy plantlets. The methods obtained here appear to be applicable to symbiotic germination of many other threatened Cypripedium spp.	Hokkaido Univ, Dept Bot, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan	Koda, Y (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Dept Bot, Grad Sch Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.	yasunori@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp	Shimura, Hanako/E-6954-2012					25	35	40	0	15	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0031-9317	1399-3054		PHYSIOL PLANTARUM	Physiol.

Protocols for asymbiotic germination of orchid seeds typically use media with high concentrations of soluble carbohydrate and minerals. However, when reintroduced into the field, seedlings obtained via asymbiotic germination have lower survival rates than do seedlings obtained via symbiotic germination. Tree fern fiber, the ideal substrate for orchid seedling acclimatization, is increasingly scarce. Here, we evaluated seed germination and protocorm development of Cyrtopodium glutiniferum Raddi cultivated in asymbiotic media (Knudson C and Murashige & Skoog) and in oatmeal agar (OA) medium inoculated with the mycorrhizal fungus Epulorhiza sp., using non-inoculated OA medium as a control. We also evaluated the performance of tree fern fiber, pine bark, eucalyptus bark, corncob and sawdust as substrates for the acclimatization of symbiotically propagated plants. We determined germination percentages, protocorm development and growth indices at 35 and 70 days of cultivation. Relative growth rates and the effects of substrates on mycorrhizal formation were calculated after 165 days of cultivation. Germination efficiency and growth indices were best when inoculated OA medium was used. Corncob and pine bark showed the highest percentages of colonized system roots. The OA medium inoculated with Epulorhiza sp. shows potential for C. glutiniferum seedling production. Corncob and pine bark are promising substitutes for tree fern fiber as substrates for the acclimatization of orchid seedlings.

Climatic variation and seed persistence: freeze-thaw cycles lower survival via the joint action of abiotic stress and fungal pathogens	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Climate change; Soil pathogens; Elymus canadensis; Phenology; Emergence	FROST DAMAGE; PLANTS; DYNAMICS; DROUGHT; TERRESTRIAL; POPULATIONS; EMERGENCE; DORMANCY; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY	Global climate change is altering thermal cycles in soils during late winter, a transition that may directly threaten seed survival via abiotic stress, facilitate infection by soil-borne pathogens, or both. Using field-collected soil and seeds of the perennial bunchgrass Elymus canadensis, we tested the hypothesis that soil freeze-thaw events limit survival within the soil through direct effects on seed persistence and amplification of soil pathogen attack using a factorial experiment that manipulated freeze-thaw cycles (constant freeze vs. freeze-thaw) and fungicide addition. Freeze-thaw treatment resulted in lower seedling emergence and delayed emergence time relative to constant-freeze controls. Fungicide-treated soils had greater emergence relative to untreated soils; the lowest seedling emergence was observed in no-fungicide, freeze-thaw-treated soils (< 1 %). The strong effects of thermal variability and fungi on seeds were mitigated through interactions at the seed-soil interface, as subsequent experiments showed that fungicide and freeze-thaw treatments alone do not influence dormancy. Our work demonstrates that changes in freeze-thaw events directly limit seedling emergence, delay seedling phenology, and provide opportunities for fungal pathogens to limit seed persistence. As recruitment from seeds is a key determinant of plant population dynamics, these results suggest that climatic variation may generate unique consequences for populations under changing climate regimes.

Despite their success, studies examining their effects on soil bioindicators such as microbial biomass carbon (C) and enzyme activities are scarce. This study elucidates the effects of drought stress and phenological stages of a typical indigenous African grass, Enteropogon macrostachyus, on microbial biomass and enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, and chitinase) in the rhizosphere soil. Enteropogon macrostachyus was grown under controlled conditions. Drought stress (partial watering) was simulated during the last 10 d of plant growth, and data were compared with those from optimum moisture conditions. The rhizosphere soil was sampled after 40 d (seedling stage), 70 d (elongation stage), and 80 d (simulated drought stress). A high root: shoot ratio at seedling stage compared with elongation and reproduction stages demonstrated that E. macrostachyus invested more on root biomass in early development, to maximise the uptake of nutrients and water. Microbial biomass and enzyme activities increased with root biomass during plant growth. Ten-day drought at reproduction stage increased the microbial biomass and enzyme activities, accompanying a decrease in binding affinity and catalytic efficiency. In conclusion, drought stress controls soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient mobilization, as well as the competition between plant and microorganisms for nutrient uptake.

The effect of osmotic potential on percent germination and time to germination for big sacaton (Sporobolus wrightii Munro) and Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica Vasey) was investigated. We predicted that seeds native to semi-arid environments would germinate at osmotic potentials less negative than about -1.5 MPa, the permanent wilting point (PWP) of many agronomic grasses. In addition, the systemic, asexual endophyte Neotyphodium is transmitted through the seed in Arizona fescue and is thought to increase germination of its host. Therefore, we also tested for an effect of the endophyte on germination and time to germination of Arizona fescue under varying osmotic potentials. To test for minimum osmotic potential supporting germination, big sacaton and Arizona fescue seeds were placed on acetate membranes in contact with PEG solutions of varying osmotic potentials for 2 weeks. Both grasses germinated at 50% of maximum germination (at soil saturation) at and below the standard PWP (-1.5 Mpa). Big sacaton and Arizona fescue germinated at 64% and 60% at -1.5 MPa, respectively, and Arizona fescue germinated at 35% at -1.8 MPa (70% was the maximum at saturation). The presence of the Neotyphodium endophyte did not affect percent or time to germination of Arizona fescue at any of the osmotic potentials tested.

Markgr.-Dannenb. by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi was quantified monthly throughout one growing cycle of the species and related to plant phenology, P nutrition and Ni concentrations of rhizospheric soil and tissue. F brigantina was systematically colonized during the eight months of the sampling period, the highest colonization preceding the beginning of the plant's reproductive period and maximum shoot investment. The morphology of colonization was of 'near-Paris' type, its main feature being the abundance of intracellular hyphal coils in plant roots. Ni concentration in the rhizospheric soil did not affect AM colonization. An extremely small shoot/root Ni concentration ratio was observed but no significant relationship was found between AM colonization and Ni translocation to the shoot. A significant relationship was found between AM colonization and root P concentration. Implications of the results to the ecology of F brigantina are discussed.

J	37	MW	Rasmussen, HN; Whigham, DF				Rasmussen, HN; Whigham, DF			Phenology of roots and mycorrhiza in orchid species differing in phototrophic strategy	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						corallorhiza; galearis; goodyera; heterotrophy; liparis; terrestrial; orchids; mycotrophy; Orchidaceae; Tipularia	GOODYERA-REPENS; PLANTS	The mycorrhiza of orchids represents an energy source that may replace or supplement photosynthesis. Dependency on mycotrophy in adult life stages would thus be expected to be inversely related to the prevalence of phototrophic structures. The phenology of underground parts and mycorrhizal infection were monitored in five terrestrial species differing in leaf phenology (and thus in phototrophic strategy): Goodyera pubescens (evergreen), Tipularia discolor (wintergreen), Galearis spectabilis and Liparis lilifolia (summergreen) and Corallorhiza odontorhiza (chlorophyll deficient), growing sympatrically in a North American deciduous forest. Mycorrhizal infection was extensive in T. discolor roots and C. odontorhiza rhizomes. Only the proximal part of roots was infected in G. pubescens, and mycorrhizal colonisation was patchy in roots and tubers of G, spectabilis and localized in the rhizome in L. lilifolia. Mycotrophic roots were long-lived (1.5-3 yrs) determinate structures and mycorrhizal infection reached maximum intensity 2-6 months after development. Mycotrophy appeared to be active all year round in mature organs. The phenology of mycotrophic roots and patterns of mycorrhizal infection were not related to the leafy season. The hypothesis that phototrophic and mycotrophic nutrition alternate through the seasons could not be confirmed. (C) New Phytologist (2002) 154: 797-807.

Chouard ex Rothm. on the formation of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) at different stages of its life cycle. H. nonscripta is a bulbous perennial with a restricted root system of coarse, unbranched elements which are plainly inadequate for the acquisition of phosphate (P) from soil. In a glasshouse experiment non-mycorrhizal H. nonscripta were unable to take up sufficient P to maintain a positive P budget, confirming that the species is obligately mycorrhizal when adult. We needed to be able to assess the ages of field-collected plants. The bulb of H. non-scripta, which is totally rebuilt annually, provides no indicator of age other than size. The development of individual bulbs was monitored in reconstructed soil profiles for several years and the relationship of size and age calculated in order to determine the age structure of a population in the field and to quantify the mycorrhizal colonization of their roots according to age and depth in the soil. Seedlings of H. non-scripta are supplied with a P-rich endosperm and initially inhabit upper soil horizons where P is plentiful. However, they are at risk from winter frosts, summer drought and, possibly, predators. During their first four to five seasons they descend in the soil to a depth of approximately 20 cm, down a gradient of decreasing soil phosphorus concentration; simultaneously, their roots become increasingly colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Because of the change in environment, they appear to become increasingly dependent on the symbiosis, suggesting that the association changes from facultative to obligate during the plant's life history.

In this work, Diversispora spurca, D. versiformis, and Funneliformis mosseae were applied to rhizosphere of potted hyacinth (Hyacinths orientalis L. Anna Marie) plants. After four months of mycorrhizal inoculation, root could be colonized by exogenous AMF species, varied from 38% to 49%, whilst F. mosseae had the best mycorrhizal status. Out of these AMF species used, only F. mosseae- inoculated plants recorded greater raceme length and biomass production of single flowerlet, raceme, and flower stem. F. mosseae also induced the flowering earlier in 2 days and prolonged flowering time for 3 days. D. versiformis postponed 2 days for flowering. Mycorrhizal plants recorded considerably higher acetic acid (IAA) and zeatin riboside (ZR) levels in flowers, irrespective of AMF species. F. mosseae-inoculated plants had significantly higher methyl jasmonate (MeJA) concentrations in flowers than other AMF- or non-AMF-treated plants. These results thereby conclude that F. mosseae can be used to regulate flowering of H. orientalis L. Anna Marie, including flowering earlier and prolonging flowering time, which is closely associated with IAA, ZR and MeJA levels in flowers.

Microbe-mediated local adaptation to limestone barrens is context dependent	ECOLOGY			English	Article						alvar; context dependency; evolutionary ecology; geographic mosaic; Hypericum perforatum (St; John's wort); limestone barrens; local adaptation; microbe-mediated adaptation	PLANT FITNESS; SPECIES INTERACTIONS; SOIL; RESPONSES; ECOLOGY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; OUTCOMES; ADVERSE; MODELS	Plant-root-associated microbes influence plant phenotype and tolerance to environmental stress, and thus have been hypothesized to play a role in plant local adaptation. Here, we test this hypothesis with factorial experiments addressing the role of microbes in local adaptation of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) to stressful limestone barrens (alvars) compared to neighboring old-fields. Alvar plants benefited more from microbes in early life history stages, while at later growth stages, alvar and old-field plants benefited equally from microbes but only in the old-field habitat. Patterns of local adaptation were changed by the presence of microbes. Alvar plants grown in association with alvar microbes outperformed old-field plants in the alvar habitat, whereas old-field plants showed patterns of maladaptation when grown with microbes. In this demonstration of microbe-mediated adaptation, we show that rhizosphere microbes can be important for plant fitness and patterns of local adaptation but that those effects are dependent on life-history stage and habitat.

We coincided our sampling with three phenologic stages of H. perforatum (preflowering, flowering, post flowering) to determine possible differences in colonization based on plant phenology. The levels of mycorrhizal colonization in H. perforatum were not significantly different between serpentine and granite sites, while levels of colonization in postflowering plants were significantly higher than in those at preflowering and flowering stages.

Effects of fertilizer, fungal endophytes and plant cultivar on the performance of insect herbivores and their natural enemies	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						cereal aphids; endophytic fungi; Neotyphodium lolii; parasitoids; trophic cascades	LOLIUM-PERENNE; NITROGEN-FERTILIZATION; TALL FESCUE; LOLITREM-B; ACREMONIUM ENDOPHYTE; ARIZONA FESCUE; HOST GENOTYPE; PERAMINE; GRASSES; RYEGRASS	1. Endophytic fungi are associates of most species of plants and may modify insect community structures through the production of toxic alkaloids. Fertilization is known to increase food plant quality for herbivores, but it is also conceivable that additional nitrogen could increase the production of the insect toxic alkaloid, peramine, in endophyte-infected plants. 2. The relative importance of soil fertility and endophyte infection on herbivores and their natural enemies is unknown. As performance of the host plant is often affected by an interaction between endophyte infection and genetic background, four different plant cultivars were tested. The main questions addressed in this study were whether plant cultivar and fertilizer addition to endophyte-infected and endophyte-free Lolium perenne affect alkaloid concentrations, plant life-history traits and the abundances of aphid species and their parasitoids. 3. In a full factorial outdoor experiment we found a strong positive effect of fertilizer on plant biomass and on the abundance of aphids and parasitoids. While plant traits differed between cultivars, there was little effect of cultivar on either aphid or parasitoid abundance. Only endophyte-infected plants contained alkaloids, and the concentration of peramine was enhanced in fertilized plants. However, endophyte infection had no negative effect on aphid or parasitoid abundances. Plant traits were only weakly influenced by endophyte infection in the field, which contrasts with plant growth room studies, where both germination rate and plant height were influenced by endophyte-cultivar interactions. 4. The generally weak effects of endophytes in the outdoor experiment could be explained by various additional constraints under field conditions and the relatively low peramine concentration that we observed.

A common garden experiment with Lolium perenne was established in a lawn in New Jersey, USA, to investigate the impact of endophyte infection and host genotype on tiller and spike production over three years. Infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants of each genotype were monitored every 2-3 mo. Infection intensity within plants varied significantly among genotypes and years, but there was no evidence of directional chan-e over time. Tiller production varied significantly among, genotypes and was affected by endophytes: E+ plants of several genotypes produced more tillers than E-plants during the third year. E+ plants had greater aboveground biomass. but host genotype explained a far greater proportion of variation in tiller production, number, and biomass than infection. Plant survival, percentage flowering, flowering date, number of spikes, and mean tiller mass were unaffected by endophytes. However, the last three variables showed significant variation among host genotypes. Although Studies have demonstrated a positive growth effect of endophytes oil several grass hosts. in this experiment host genotype accounted for far more of the variation in tiller and spike production and in biomass of Lolium perenne than endophyte infection.

We cloned an miR156 homolog, LjmiR156a, from L. japonicus, and investigated its SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE (SPL) genes and its biological function at enhancing vegetative biomass yield, extending flowering time, and its impact on nodulation. Thirteen potential targets for LjmiR156 were identified in vitro and their expression profiles were determined in aerial and underground parts of mature plants, including genes coding for eight SPLs, one WD-40, one RNA-directed DNA polymerase, two transport proteins, and one histidine-phosphotransfer protein. Two SPL and one WD-40 cleavage targets for LjmiR156-TC70253, AU089191, and TC57859-were identified. Transgenic plants with ectopic expression of LjmiR156a showed enhanced branching, dramatically delayed flowering, underdeveloped roots, and reduced nodulation. We also examined the transcript levels of key genes involved in nodule organogenesis and infection thread formation to determine the role of miR156 in regulating symbiosis. Overexpression of LjmiR156a led to repression of several nodulation genes during the early stages of root development such as three ENOD genes, SymPK, POLLUX, CYCLOPS, Cerberus, and Nsp1, and the stimulation of NFR1. Our results show that miR156 regulates vegetative biomass yield, flowering time and nodulation by silencing downstream target SPLs and other genes, suggesting that the miR156 regulatory network could be modified in forage legumes (such as alfalfa and trefoils) and in leafy vegetables (like lettuce and spinach) to positively impact economically valuable crop species.

Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte fungi (MucFRE) were found to engage in nutritional mutualism withLycopodiella inundata, which belongs to one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1305 individualL. inundataroots from 275 plants collected during spring and autumn 2019 across 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of fine root endophyte (FRE) hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. Fine root endophyte hyphae were dominant in all of the examined heathlands, and every colonized root had FRE in both cortical cells and root hairs. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% ofL. inundataroots were colonized in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, correlating with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to root and related hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about FRE from single time point collections should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation treatments, and microbial diversity studies.

Major differences from the wild-type LPS were observed in (i) hexose and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate elution profiles of crude phenol extracts chromatographed in Sepharose CL-4B, (ii) silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of crude and purified LPS fractions, and (iii) immunoreactivities otherwise present in purified LPS of the parental strain Rm2011. In addition, Rm6963 lost the ability to grow in Luria-Bertani medium containing the hydrophobic compounds sodium deoxycholate or SDS and showed a decrease in survival in TY medium supplemented with high calcium concentrations. The mutant also had altered symbiotic properties. Rm6963 formed nodules that fixed nitrogen but showed a delayed or even reduced ability to nodulate the primary root of alfalfa without showing changes in the position of nodule distribution profiles along the roots. Furthermore, 2 to 3 weeks after inoculation, plants nodulated by Rm6963 were smaller than control plants inoculated with wild-type bacteria in correlation with a transient decrease in nitrogen fixation. In most experiments, the plants recovered later by expressing a full nitrogen-fixing phenotype and developing an abnormally high number of small nodules in lateral roots after 1 month. Rm6963 was also deficient in the ability to compete for nodulation. In coinoculation experiments with equal bacterial numbers of both mutant and wild-type rhizobia, only the parent was recovered from the uppermost root nodules. A strain ratio of approximately 100 to 1 favoring the mutant was necessary to obtain an equal ratio (1:1) of nodule occupancy. These results show that alterations in Rm6963 which include LPS changes lead to an altered symbiotic phenotype during the association with alfalfa that affects the timing of nodule emergence, the progress of nitrogen fixation, and the strain competitiveness for nodulation.

The extent, however, to which patterns of carbon allocation from shoots to roots affect the timing and quantity of organic carbon release from roots to soil is not known. We employed a novel approach to study how natural short-term variation in the allocation of carbon to roots may affect rhizosphere soil biology. Taking advantage of the semi-determinate phenology of young northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), we examined how pulsed delivery of carbon from shoots to roots affected dynamics of soil respiration as well as microbial biomass and net nitrogen mineralization in the rhizosphere. Young Q. rubra exhibit (1) clear switches in the amount of carbon allocated below-ground that are non-destructively detected simply by observing pulsed shoot growth above-ground, and (2) multiple switches in internal carbon allocation during a single growing season, ensuring our ability to detect short-term effects of plant carbon allocation on rhizosphere biology separate from longer-term seasonal effects. In both potted oaks and oaks rooted in soil, soil respiration varied inversely with shoot flush stage through several oak shoot flushes. In addition, upon destructive harvest of potted oaks, microbial biomass in the rhizosphere of saplings with actively flushing shoots was lower than microbial biomass in the rhizosphere of saplings with shoots that were not flushing. Given that plants have evolved with their roots in contact with soil microbes, known species-specific carbon allocation patterns within plants may provide insight into interactions among roots, symbionts, and free-living microbes in the dynamic soil arena.

Phylogenetically isolated host-plants might share few mutualists with their neighbours and might suffer from a decrease in mutualist support. In addition host plants leaving their ancestral niche might face a deterioration of their abiotic and biotic environment and might hence need to invest more into mutualist partners. We tested whether phylogenetic isolation of hosts from neighbours decreases or increases abundance and activity of their mutualists and whether mutualist activity may help to compensate deterioration of the environment. We study oak-hosts and their ectomycorrhizal fungi mutualists established in the litter layer formed by the phylogenetically closely or distantly related neighbourhood. We find that oaks surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours show increased abundance and enzymatic activity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the litter. Moreover, oaks surrounded by phylogenetically distant neighbours also show delayed budburst but ectomycorrhizal fungi activity partly compensates this negative effect of phylogenetic isolation. This suggests decreased nutrient availability in a phylogenetically distant litter partly compensated by increased litter-degradation by ectomycorrhizal fungi activity. Most observed effects of phylogenetic isolation cannot be explained by a change in baseline soil fertility (as reflected by nutritional status of fresh oak litter, or soil microbial biomass and activity) nor by simple reduction of percentages of oak neighbours, nor by the presence of gymnosperms. Our results show that colonizing new niche represented by the presence of distantly related neighbours may delay plant phenology but may be supported by mycorrhizal mutualists. Studies on other host-plant species are required to generalize our findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it is not known if arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that co-exist in soil communities have similar tolerances to stresses such as drought and freezing. The phenology of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was determined over one year in a community in southern Ontario, Canada. Five fungal species from the same community were then used to inoculate five plant species, in all possible combinations, and were subjected to either a freezing treatment or a drought treatment after which new seedlings were transplanted into the treated pots. The percent colonization of roots of each plant species was measured as the difference in mean colonization from the control. Freezing reduced percent colonization in almost every case, whereas drought resulted in both increased and decreased percent colonization. Fungal species responded differently to the treatments, and there was a pronounced plant x fungus effect. These results support the hypothesis that distinct functional groups of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi exist, and these may determine plant community structure.

Fungal specificity bottlenecks during orchid germination and development	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						epiparasitism; myco-heterotrophy; symbiosis; Thelephoraceae	BIOLOGY; SEED	Fungus-subsidized growth through the seedling stage is the most critical feature of the life history for the thousands of mycorrhizal plant species that propagate by means of 'dust seeds.' We investigated the extent of specificity towards fungi shown by orchids in the genera Cephalanthera and Epipactis at three stages of their life cycle: (i) initiation of germination, (ii) during seedling development, and (iii) in the mature photosynthetic plant. It is known that in the mature phase, plants of these genera can be mycorrhizal with a number of fungi that are simultaneously ectomycorrhizal with the roots of neighbouring forest trees. The extent to which earlier developmental stages use the same or a distinctive suite of fungi was unclear. To address this question, a total of 1500 packets containing orchid seeds were buried for up to 3 years in diverse European forest sites which either supported or lacked populations of helleborine orchids. After harvest, the fungi associated with the three developmental stages, and with tree roots, were identified via cultivation-independent molecular methods. While our results show that most fungal symbionts are ectomycorrhizal, differences were observed between orchids in the representation of fungi at the three life stages. In Cephalanthera damasonium and C. longifolia, the fungi detected in seedlings were only a subset of the wider range seen in germinating seeds and mature plants. In Epipactis atrorubens, the fungi detected were similar at all three life stages, but different fungal lineages produced a difference in seedling germination performance. Our results demonstrate that there can be a narrow checkpoint for mycorrhizal range during seedling growth relative to the more promiscuous germination and mature stages of these plants' life cycle.

The purpose of this study was to understand how phosphorus uptake relates to the phenology of R. adoneus and to ascertain whether arbusculus, fungal structures used for nutrient transfer. were present when maximum phosphorus accumulation was occurring. Arbuscules were only present for a few weeks during the growing season of R. adoneus and their presence corresponded with increased phosphorus accumulation in both the roots and shoots of R. udoneus. In addition, phosphorus accumulation and peaks in mycorrhizal development occurred well after plant reproduction and most plant growth had occurred. The late season accumulation of phosphorus by mycorrhizal roots of R. adoneus is stored for use during early season growth and flowering the following spring. In this way R. adoneus can flower before soils thaw and root or mycorrhizal nutrient uptake can occur.

At the dry sedimentation pond, root samples of Juncus effusus and Salix atrocinerea were also taken to assess the presence of AMF throughout the year. Root colonisation was low (<5% root length colonised) but arbuscule presence peaked in P. australis during the spring and autumn prior to flowering. These changes in arbuscule abundance were also seen in a parallel greenhouse trial using seed taken from one of the sites. Roots of J. effusus contained mainly vesicular colonisation but arbuscule activity peaked during the winter months (December-March). S. atrocinerea roots were found to be ectomycorrhizal throughout the year but the fine feeder roots were colonised by AMF The results confirm that semi-aquatics, like P. australis, can become arbuscular mycorrhizal but that this status changes during the year depending on soil moisture content and plant phenology. The influence of AMF in these polluted soils is uncertain but the potential exists to establish a more diverse plant ecosystem during the landscaping of these areas (phytostabilisation) by management of adapted plant and AMF ecotypes.

Tree susceptibility to these pathogens with respect to phenology was studied using artificial fungal inoculations at six stages of bud development, and assessed by measuring phloem necroses in the stems of 2- and 8-year-old trees. Tree capacity for resistance was assessed by measuring phloem nonstructural carbohydrates at each stage. Phloem necroses were significantly larger in trees with fungal versus control inoculations and increased significantly over time. Changes in nonstructural carbohydrates occurred in the trees; a significant decline in starch and a slight but significant increase in total sugars occurred over time. These results suggest that susceptibility to fungal pathogens and carbohydrate levels in the stems of the trees were related to fine-scale changes in bud development. A trade-off may occur between allocation of starch (the major fraction of the stem carbohydrate pool) to bud development/shoot growth versus defence of the stem. Previous tests of plant defence hypotheses have focused on herbivory on plants growing under different environmental conditions, but the role of phenology and the effect of pathogens are also important to consider in understanding plant resource allocation patterns.

The seed originated from the three populations that represent the overall ecological and productive conditions of Serbian spruce populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Two natural populations were selected: Veliki Stolac and Gostilj, and one planted forest population in Srebrenica. The cones were collected in late autumn 2009 and early spring 2010. They were collected from five trees from Srebrenica and Gostilj, and seven trees from Veliki Stolac. Immediately after they were collected, the cones and seeds were processed and germination tests were done. Germination, germination viability and germination dynamics were studied in three categories of seed treatment: 1) control unit (just processed seed), 2) seed stored for six months at 0-4 degrees C, 3) seed stored for seven months at 0-4 degrees C and treated with fungicide after five months of storing. The number of germinated seed was observed and noted on the third, fourth, fifth, seventh, tenth, fourteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eighth day. There were significant differences in germination dynamics at the population level and the level of treatment during the first couple of days of germination test. Fungicide (captan) acted as an inhibitor on seed germination process. The seeds originating from the largest population of Veliki Stolac showed the best response to storing treatment with fungicide related to germination dynamics. The seed originating from Srebrenica andkept at low temperatures 0-4 degrees C without treatment with fungicides showed the best result in germination. Regardless of the presence of differences in the dynamics of germination, significant differences in germination regarding different treatments on the last day of the test, were not recorded.

In a two phase experiment, Pinus muricata seedlings were co-inoculated with spores of early (Rhizopogon occidentalis ) and late (Tomentella sublilacina ) successional dominant EMF, with or without squirrel faecal pellets added as a nutrient source, in single chambers (Phase A) subsequently converted to split-root chambers (Phase B). R. occidentalis colonized seedlings earlier than T. sublilacina . R. occidentalis root tip numbers peaked then declined in both treatments, but earlier in the minus pellet treatment than the plus. T. sublilacina increased steadily regardless of treatment. In the split-root treatment, we found no response by R. occidentalis , and a complex response by T. sublilacina , suggesting that plant nutrition may affect colonization dynamics. The strategy of R. occidentalis may be to colonize roots early in high resource environments; whereas that of T. sublilacina may be based upon slower colonization rates and greater competitive ability. The effect of nutrient additions on R. occidentalis may be highly dependent upon their timing.

All bacterial strains significantly increased the speed of seedling emergence over nontreated pine seed. By 12 wk, however, no differences in stand densities were observed between bacteria-treated and nontreated seed for either pine species. Postemergence damping-off was reduced in loblolly pine when seed was treated with 3 of the 12 bacterial strains; however, postemergence damping-off on slash pine seedlings was not affected by rhizobacteria. Treatment with rhizobacteria had a significant positive and negative effect on seedling growth and biomass, which depended on tree species. Loblolly pine shoot and root lengths, as well as the above-and belowground biomass, were significantly reduced when seeds were treated with strains BS1 and BS2. In contrast, loblolly pine seeds treated with strains BS3, PM2, and INR7 significantly increased the below ground biomass of the seedling root systems. Slash pine seedlings had similar interactions with the bacterial strains. Strain BS1 significantly reduced shoot lengths compared with nontreated seeds, while strains 90-166, INR7, and SE49 increased shoot biomass. Slash pine root lengths and biomass were also reduced when treated with strains BS1 and BS2. Unlike loblolly pine, no bacterial strain increased slash pine root length or biomass. Th is study suggests th at the effects of rhizobacteria inoculation on seeding emergence and plant growth are independent and that the effects are species specific.

A mutualistic endophyte alters the niche dimensions of its host plant	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Epichloe; fungal endophyte; mutualism; Poa leptocoma; Poa reflexa; symbiosis	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; PERENNIAL RYEGRASS; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; STRESS TOLERANCE; TALL FESCUE; SYMBIOSIS; COMMUNITY; GRASSES; COEXISTENCE	Mutualisms can play important roles in influencing species coexistence and determining community composition. However, few studies have tested whether such interactions can affect species distributions by altering the niches of partner species. In subalpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, USA, we explored whether the presence of a fungal endophyte (genus Epichloe) may shift the niche of its partner plant, marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) relative to a closely related but endophyte-free grass species, nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa). Using observations and a 3-year field experiment, we tested two questions: (i) Do P. leptocoma and P. reflexa occupy different ecological niches? and (ii) Does endophyte presence affect the relative fitness of P. leptocoma versus P. reflexa in the putative niches of these grass species? The two species were less likely to co-occur than expected by chance. Specifically, P. leptocoma grew closer to water sources and in wetter soils than P. reflexa, and also had higher root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma seeds germinated with greater frequency in P. leptocoma niches relative to P. reflexa niches, whereas neither endophyte-free (experimentally removed) P. leptocoma seeds nor P. reflexa seeds showed differential germination between the two niche types. Thus, endophyte presence constrained the germination and early survival of host plants to microsites occupied by P. leptocoma. However, endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma ultimately showed greater growth than endophyte-free plants across all microsites, indicating a net benefit of the symbiosis at this life history stage. Differential effects of endophyte symbiosis on different host life history stages may thus contribute to niche partitioning between the two congeneric plant species. Our study therefore identifies a symbiotic relationship as a potential mechanism facilitating the coexistence of two species, suggesting that symbiont effects on host niche may have community-level consequences.

Using a foundation tree species, Populus angustifolia, observational and common garden approaches, and a base population genetic collection that spans 17 river systems in the western United States, from AZ to MT, we show that (a) as mean annual temperature (MAT) increases, genetic and phenotypic variation for bud break phenology decline; (b) soil microbiomes, soil nitrogen (N), and soil carbon (C) vary in response to MAT and conditioning by trees; and (c) with losses of genetic variation due to warming, population-level regulation of community and ecosystem functions strengthen. These results demonstrate a relationship between the potential evolutionary response of populations and subsequent shifts in ecosystem function along a large temperature gradient.

Host phenology and potential saprotrophism of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the boreal forest	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						decomposition; ectomycorrhizal exploration type; extracellular enzymes; invertase; nonstructural carbohydrates; nutrient cycling; phenology; Populus tremuloides	CARBON SEQUESTRATION; EXPLORATION TYPES; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SEASONAL-CHANGES; ORGANIC-MATTER; COMMUNITY; TREES; DEFOLIATION; INVERTASE	1. Phenology-induced changes in carbon assimilation by trees may affect carbon stored in fine roots and as a consequence, alter carbon allocated to ectomycorrhizal fungi. Two competing models exist to explain carbon mobilization by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Under the 'saprotrophy model', decreased allocation of carbon may induce saprotrophic behaviour in ectomycorrhizal fungi, resulting in the decomposition of organic matter to mobilize carbon. Alternatively, under the 'nutrient acquisition model', decomposition may instead be driven by the acquisition of nutrients locked within soil organic matter compounds, with carbon mobilization a secondary process. 2. We tested whether phenology-induced shifts in carbon reserves of fine roots of aspen (Populus tremuloides) affect potential activity of four carbon-compound degrading enzymes, beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and laccase, by ectomycorrhizal fungi. Ectomycorrhizal roots from mature aspen were collected across eight stands in north-eastern Alberta, Canada, and analysed during tree dormancy, leaf flush, full leaf expansion and leaf abscission. We predicted potential extracellular enzyme activity to be highest when root carbon reserves were lowest, should host phenology induce saprotrophism. Further, we anticipated enzyme activity to be mediated by invertase, a plant-derived enzyme which makes carbon available to fungal symbionts in the plant-fungus interface. 3. Root carbon reserves were positively correlated with invertase, suggesting phenology may affect carbon allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, of the four enzymes, host phenology had the largest effect on beta-glucuronidase, but activity of this enzyme was not correlated with root carbon reserves or invertase. Low-biomass ectomycorrhizas had greater potential laccase activity than high-biomass ectomycorrhizas, highlighting discrete functional traits in fungi for litter decomposition. 4. Our results suggest that the decomposition of organic matter may be driven by foraging by fungi for nutrients locked within organic compounds rather than for mobilizing carbon. Furthermore, the potential ability to degrade lignin was more common in low-biomass ectomycorrhizas when compared to high-biomass ectomycorrhizas.

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE			English	Article						purple loosestrife; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; plant reproduction	LYCOPERSICON-ESCULENTUM MILL; PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE; INFECTION; FIELD; WILD	Lythrum salicaria L., purple loosestrife, is a heterostylous, perennial plant with prolific and at times invasive vegetative growth and sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction occurs following pollination and fertilization between two different floral morphs. We investigated the influence of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, Glomus aggregatum Schenck and Smith emend. Koske, on the vegetative growth and sexual reproductive potential of L. salicaria. Mycorrhiza decreased plant biomass both aboveground and belowground. Flower production, number of days to anthesis, numbers of flowers per inflorescence, and inflorescence lengths were not significantly different between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal treatments. However, pollen production per anther and per flower increased with mycorrhizal colonization. Though ovule production was not affected, some aspects of purple loosestrife morphology did change. Plants with mycorrhizae produced inflorescence (in lateral positions) further up the stem. In addition, flower distribution within an inflorescence differed according to morph (short, mid, and long style) such that in the mid and long morphs flower number increased with inflorescence length and was unevenly distributed, while in the short morph this distribution appeared even. The relative biomass of stems, leaves, lateral branches, and reproductive structures were not significantly different in mycorrhizal plants, whereas in the absence of mycorrhizal colonization, stem biomass was higher relative to other structures. This study suggests some vegetative and reproductive characteristics in purple loosestrife change with an association with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.

Infection of blackcurrant flowers and fruits by Botrytis cinerea in relation to weather conditions and fruit age	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Latent infection; Fruit maturity; Resistance	STRAWBERRY FLOWERS; RED RASPBERRY; GRAY MOLD	Experiments were conducted to investigate infection of blackcurrant flowers and fruits in relation to environmental conditions and fruit age on cvs. Baldwin and Ben Hope. The two cultivars did not differ significantly in the susceptibility of flowers to Botrytis infection. Nearly 75% of flowers were infected or abscised I week after inoculation and nearly all remaining flowers failed to develop into mature fruit. Fruits were inoculated at different growth stages and then incubated under different initial conditions: 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C each with four wet periods (4, 8, 12 and 24 h). Infection of fruit was not significantly affected by the temperature and duration of wetness. The two cultivars; differed significantly in their responses to Botrytis infection depending on the fruiting stage at the time of inoculation. Inoculation of young fruitlets resulted in nearly 50% of fruits aborted on cv. Baldwin, compared to ca. 10% on cv. Ben Hope. Inoculation of fruit near harvest resulted in significantly fewer fruit aborted. The incidence of latent infection decreased with increasing fruit age at the time of inoculation. Sampling of blackcurrant fruit and spraying timing trials in planting of these two cultivars in open-field and under-protected conditions supported the main conclusions drawn from the controlled inoculation studies. Thus irrespective of weather conditions, strategies must be adopted to reduce inoculum and the extent of flower infections. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim was to assess whether life-history strategies influence AMF successional dynamics and assemblages. Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) seedlings, grown in a mesocosm system, were colonized by either the AMF hyphae coming from a living rosemary plant, or from spores germinating in soil. The AMF community established in the plantlets was monitored every 3 months during 2 years, using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of genes coding for rDNA. The two different sources of AMF propagules resulted in a different initial community colonizing rosemary roots. AMF propagating from hyphae attached to living mycorrhizal-roots seemed to colonize faster and were season-dependent. AMF taxa originating from soil-borne propagules were most frequent over time and exhibit the dominant colonization strategy in this system. The evolution of the AMF community also revealed different strategies in succession. AMF associated with rosemary evidenced contrasting life-history strategies in terms of source of inoculum for new colonization and hence survival. The observed successional dynamics of AMF have implications for understanding the ecological processes in Mediterranean environments and seasonality of colonization processes.

The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity associated to Tamarix articulata and Tamarix gallica rhizosphere was investigated in the Algerian steppic area. Evaluation of species diversity revealed the presence of 10 glomoid and one gigasporoid spore types of AMF species from the ten studied sites. Shannon biodiversity index showed that AMF species diversity varied according to soil physico-chemical characteristics of the different sites. However, seasonal variation affected abundance but not AMF species biodiversity. Significant effect of soil and seasons on AMF root colonization rate was also observed. Overall, AMF Tamarix root colonization rates varied according to the species ranging from 0.88 to 75.26% in T. articulata and from 1.90 to 12.96% in T. gallica. This study highlighted the complexity of Tamarix species/AMF symbiosis through seasons associated with plant phenology and soil physico-chemical composition in arid and semi-arid steppes.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the importance of seasons, elevation, and soil depth in determining soil fungal and bacterial communities, given the influence of climate conditions, soil properties and plant traits. In this study, seasonal patterns of diversity and abundance did not synchronize between fungi and bacteria, where soil fertility explained the diversity and abundance of soil fungi but soil water content explained those of soil bacteria. Model-based clustering showed that seasonal changes in both abundant and rare taxonomic groups were different between soil fungi and bacteria. The cluster represented by ectomycorrhizal genus Lactarius was a dominant group across soil fungal communities and fluctuated seasonally. For soil bacteria, the clusters composed of dominant genera were seasonally stable but varied greatly depending on elevation and soil depth. Seasonally changing clusters of soil bacteria (e.g., Nitrospira and Pelosinus) were not dominant groups and were related to plant phenology. These findings suggest that the contribution of seasonal changes in climate conditions, soil fertility, and plant phenology to microbial communities might be equal to or greater than the effects of spatial heterogeneity of those factors. Our study identifies aboveground-belowground components as key factors explaining how microbial communities change during a year in forest soils at mid-to-high latitudes.

Agaricales fungi showed maximum species richness at the beginning of rainy seasons, probably due to the important litter accumulation during the dry season and the increase in humidity favoring fungal growth. Species richness declined during the wet season possibly due to torrential rains, moulds, and decreasing availability of nutrients. Occurrence of foliar pathogenic microfungi correlated negatively with flushing of new leaves at the beginning of the rainy season. Their incidence increased during the wet season and remained high during the dry season. Synchronization of leaf shedding in most tree species significantly reduced the yearly incidence of foliar pathogenic fungi causing an annual turn-over of fungal pathogens that probably contributes to maintain a high diversity of plant pathogenic species.

Soil microbes are sensitive to soil water: air ratio and to nutrient availability. We studied if within-year seasonality in precipitation and litterfall-derived nutrient input resulted in predictable seasonal variation in soil bacterial diversity/microbial functional groups in an Amazonian forest. We characterised the spatio-temporal dynamics of microbial communities from the plot to the stand scales and related them to precipitation seasonality and spatial variability in soil characteristics. Community composition and functional diversity showed high spatial heterogeneity and was related to variability in soil chemistry at the stand level. Large species turnover characterised plot level changes over time, reflecting precipitation seasonality-related changes in soil nutrient and moisture regimes. The abundance of decomposers was highest during the rainy season, characterised also by anaerobic saprophytes and N-2-fixers adapted to fluctuating redox conditions. In contrast, Beijerinckiaceae, likely derived from the phyllosphere, were found at higher abundances when litter inputs and accumulation were highest. We showed that in a mildly seasonal rain forest, the composition of soil microbial communities appears to be following canopy phenology patterns and the two are interlinked and drive soil nutrient availability.

To determine the effect of flower age on infection, stigmata were inoculated with conidia of M. vaccinii-corymbosi between 0 and 5 days after anthesis, fungal growth rates through the stylar canal were measured in detached flowers in the laboratory, and fruit disease incidence was determined in plants grown in the greenhouse. Hyphal growth rates were greatest in flowers inoculated on the day of anthesis, declined linearly with increasing flower age at inoculation (r = 0.921: P< 0.0001; n = 12), and were unaffected by the presence or absence of pollen applied at the time of inoculation. In greenhouse-grown plants, the percentage of infected fruit decreased exponentially with increasing flower age at inoculation (R = 0.878; P = 0.0057; n = 10). with disease incidence ranging from 76.4% for flowers inoculated on the day of anthesis to 15.5% for those inoculated 4 days later. Fruit disease incidence in the greenhouse was linearly correlated with hyphal growth rates in detached flowers (r = 0.985: P < 0.0001: n = 9), justifying the use of detached flowers when investigating gynoecial infection by M. vaccinii-corymbosi. In separate experiments. the effects of timing and sequence of pollination and inoculation on hyphal growth rates through the stylar canal and on disease incidence were investigated. Application of pollen to detached flowers 1 or 2 days before inoculation reduced hyphal growth rates by between 14.0 and 42.9% compared with flowers that received pollen and conidia simultaneously. Similarly, reductions in fruit disease incidence by between 9.5 and 18.3% were observed on greenhouse-grown plants for pollination-to-inoculation intervals ranging from I to 4 days. These results document that newly opened flowers, are most susceptible to infection by M. vaccinii-corymbosi and that fruit disease incidence is reduced if pollination occurs at least 1 day before inoculation. Strategies that lead to early pollination of newly opened flowers may be useful for managing mummy berry disease in the field.

Yet, whether mycorrhizae affect traits important to pollination remains poorly understood and may depend on the match between host and fungal genotypes. Here, we examined how ericoid mycorrhizal fungi affected flowering phenology, floral traits, and reproductive success, among eight genotypes of highbush blueberry, Vaccinium corymbosum (Ericaceae). We asked three overarching questions: (1) Do genotypes differ in response to inoculation? (2) How does inoculation affect floral and flowering traits? (3) Are inoculated plants more attractive to pollinators and less pollen limited than non-inoculated plants of the same genotype? Methods To examine these questions, we experimentally inoculated plants with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, grew the plants in the field, and measured flowering and floral traits over 2 years. In year 2, we conducted a hand-pollination experiment to test whether plants differed in pollen limitation. Results Inoculated plants had significantly higher levels of colonization for some genotypes, and there were significant floral trait changes in inoculated plants for some genotypes as well. On average, inoculated plants produced significantly larger floral displays, more fruits per inflorescence, and heavier fruits with lower sugar content, than non-inoculated, control plants. Hand pollination enhanced the production of fruits, and fruit mass, for non-inoculated plants but not for those that were inoculated. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi enhanced flowering and altered investment in reproduction in genotype-specific ways. These findings underscore the importance of examining belowground symbionts and genotype-specific responses in their hosts to fully understand the drivers of aboveground interactions.

This study provides a comprehensive culture-independent microbiome analysis from the sap of grapevine overtime and in a context of a vascular disease. The vascular system plays a key role by transporting nutrient, water and signals throughout the plant. The negative pressure in the xylem conduits, and low oxygen and nutrient content of its sap make it a unique and underexplored microbial environment. We hypothesized that grapevine hosts in its sap, microbes that have a beneficial impact on plant health by protecting against pathogen attack and supporting key biological processes. To address this hypothesis, we chose a vineyard under high Pierce's disease (PD). PD is caused by the xylem-dwelling pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. We selected ten grapevines within this vineyard with a range of disease phenotypes, and monitored them over 2 growing seasons. We sampled each vines at key phenological stages (bloom, veraison, and post-harvest) and used an amplicon metagenomics approach to profile the bacterial (16S-V4) and fungal (ITS) communities of the sap. We identified a core microbiome of the sap composed of seven bacterial (Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, Massilia, Acinetobacter and Bacillus) and five fungal (Cladosporium, Mycosphaerella, Alternaria, Aureobasidium, and Filobasidium) taxa that were present throughout the growing season. Overall, the sap microbial makeup collected from canes was more similar to the root microbial profile. Alpha diversity metrics indicated a microbial enrichment at bloom and in vines with moderate PD severity suggesting a host-driven microbial response to environmental cues. Beta diversity metrics demonstrated that disease condition and plant phenology impacted microbial community profiles. Our study identified several potential taxonomic targets with antimicrobial and plant growth promoting capabilities that inhabit the grapevine sap and that should be further tested as potential biological control or biofertilizer agents.

The aim of this study was to unravel the biodiversity of the bacterial rhizosphere microbiota of grapevine in an integrated pest management vineyard located in Piedmont, Italy. Comparison between the microbial community structure in the bulk and rhizosphere soil (variable: space) were performed. Moreover, the possible shifts of the bulk and rhizosphere soil microbiota according to two phenological stages such as flowering and early fruit development (variable: time) were characterized. The grapevine microbiota was identified using metagenomics and next-generation sequencing. Biodiversity was higher in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil, independent of the phenological stage. Actinobacteria were the dominant class with frequencies >= 50% in all the soil samples, followed by Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Bacteroidetes. While Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are well-known as being dominant in soil, this is the first time the presence of Gemmatimonadetes has been observed in vineyard soils.

GROWTH, MINERAL-COMPOSITION AND EFFECT OF SINK REMOVAL	PLANTA			English	Article						CARBOHYDRATE AND NITROGEN DISTRIBUTION; NITRATE; NITROGENASE ACTIVITY; NITROGEN FIXATION; RESPIRATION	DINITROGEN FIXATION; GRAIN LEGUMES; NODULATION; EVOLUTION; NODULES; PLANTS	This study was undertaken to determine how carbon utilization of fruit production might affect symbiotic activity in hydroponically cultured white bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) cv. Rico and its supernodulating genotype R32-BS15 (abbreviated as RBS15). Total plant biomass production of both genotypes was similar. Nodule dry weight of RBS15 consistently scored approximately twice the amount recorded for Rico, while nodule numbers in the mutant were almost six times as high. Nodule respiration on a per-plant basis and specific respiration was initially (day 37) disproportionally higher in the mutant, reaching up to three times the values recorded for Rico, while plant N, fixation estimated by N-15 dilution was almost identical. This indicates a lower fixation efficiency of RBS 1 5 nodules, which we suggest to be a result of the larger number of smaller nodules with a higher proportion of growth and maintenance respiration per unit nodule mass. During reproductive development, specific respiration of the mutant dropped below that of Rico without a reduction in fixation, indicating a change in relative efficiency of fixation. Continuous removal of fruits from day 37 onwards stimulated respiration of nodules in both genotypes with highest values per plant being documented for RBS 15, while specific activity was higher for Rico. The results indicate that symbiotic activity was not detrimentally affected by competition for carbohydrates between fruits and nodules. It appeared that nodules did not possess excess N2-fixation capacity which could be stimulated by additional provision of photosynthate. Hence, the early onset of reproduction during the life cycle of P. vulgaris is unlikely to be responsible for inadequate fixation performance in the field.

Phosphorus supply alters tuber composition, flower production, and mycorrhizal responsiveness of container-grown hybrid Zantedeschia	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizae; calla lily; Glomus intraradices; Zantedeschia 'Pot of Gold'; Zantedeschia 'Majestic Red'	DRY-MATTER ACCUMULATION; SOIL PASTEURIZATION; PLANT-GROWTH; INOCULATION; FUNGI; INFECTION; YIELD; NUTRITION; BENEFIT; TOMATO	One-year old tubers of two hybrid calla lily (calla) cultivars (Zantedeschia 'Pot of Gold' and 'Majestic Red') were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), Glomus intraradices, or not, and grown at three different rates of phosphorus (P) supply to asses the effects of AMF-inoculation on plant development (time of shoot emergence and flowering), flowering (number, length and rate of flowering), and tuber biomass and composition over two growing cycles (2002, 2003). Tubers and flowers of calla responded differently to AMF inoculation. Differences in mycorrhizal responsiveness between cultivars was related to differences in P requirements for flower and tuber production, and the influence of P supply on resource allocation to different reproductive strategies. Inoculation increased shoot production and promoted early flowering, particularly in 2003. Inoculated plants also produced larger tubers than non-inoculated plants, but only increased the number of flowers per plant in 2003. High P supply also increased tuber biomass, but decreased the number of flowers per plant in 2002. Plants grown at a moderate P-rate, produced the most flowers in 2003. For 'Majestic Red', benefits from AMF were primarily in terms of tuber yield and composition, and AMF effects on marketable flower production could potentially have negative impact on production strategies for growers. Inoculation of 'Pot of Gold' primarily influenced flower production and aspects of tuber quality that caused detectable enhancement of tuber yield and flowering in the second growing cycle following inoculation (2003). The results of this study show that the responses of calla to AMF are partially a function of how nutrient supply alters resource allocation to sexual and vegetative reproduction. Whether AMF-induced changes in resource allocation to flowering and tubers significantly alters commercial productivity and quality of calla depends on the crop production goals (e.g. tubers, cut flowers or potted plants).

The research work was carried out in 2010-2011. The treatments included uninoculated control and plants inoculated with pure cultures of AM species (Acaulospora laevis, A. scrobiculata, Glomus coremioides, G. intraradices G. fasciculatum, G. mannihotis and Gigaspora albida). A complete randomized block design in factorial arrangement with five replicates was employed. Root and shoot length and dry weight, number of lateral branches, number of days required for flowering, and number, diameter, fresh weight of flower and fresh weight loss of flower/day were recorded. Results showed that inoculation of AM species had a significant effect on plant growth and flower quantity and quality. Increased flower number in C. morifolium (11-22%) and T. erecta (13-66%) was observed upon AM inoculation compared with the uninoculated control. Glomus intraradices proved to be the most efficient AM fungal bioinoculant, increasing flower number in both the plant species. This is attributed to its ability to colonize and multiply at a faster rate than the other AM fungal species used in the study.	[Vaingankar, J. D.; Rodrigues, B.

Williams 82). With the exception of endochitinase, activity of these enzymes also was associated with Rhizoctonia solani isolate 2B-12, causal agent of soybean root rot. In greenhouse experiments, soybean seeds inoculated with T. harzianum Th008 were planted in a soil mixture infested with R. solani 2B-12. At 15 days after emergence, the rhizosphere was assayed for chitinolytic enzymes and endoglucanase. Only N-acetylglucosaminidase and endochitinase activities in the rhizosphere samples mere significantly elevated above the controls. Using conventional specific enzyme assays and accepted methodologies including HPLC and native and SDS-PAGE slab-gels, it was determined that T. harzianum Th008 was the source of the endochitinase in the rhizosphere. On the other hand, the detectable levels of N-acetylglucosaminidase originated from the roots of soybean seedlings. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

Contrasting effects of winter snowpack and soil frost on growing season microbial biomass and enzyme activity in two mixed-hardwood forests	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Snow removal; Soil frost; Hubbard Brook; Harvard Forest extracellular enzyme; Winter climate change	BROOK EXPERIMENTAL FOREST; SUGAR MAPLE TREES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; INORGANIC NITROGEN; CURRENT KNOWLEDGE; FUTURE CHANGES; UNITED-STATES; NEW-HAMPSHIRE; ECOSYSTEM	Winter is recognized as an important time for microbial activity that influences biogeochemical cycles. The onset of the winter snowpack in temperate hardwood ecosystems has been and will continue to be delayed over the next century. The decline in snowpack results in more soil freeze-thaw events and lower winter soil temperatures. Understanding microbial responses to varying snowpack conditions is important to understanding the effect of climate change on forest ecosystems. To this end, we removed snow to simulate a thinner, more ephemeral snowpack at two sites in the northeastern US, Harvard Forest (MA) and Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (NH). We then measured microbial and exoenzyme activity in soils following snowmelt and three additional time points across the growing season. We found that microbial and exoenzyme activity were both positively correlated with the depth and duration of the snowpack at each site. The depth and duration of soil frost were negatively correlated with microbial biomass, exoenzyme activity and respiration, but only at Harvard Forest and not at Hubbard Brook. At both sites the changes in microbial and exoenzyme activity were transient and did not persist into the growing season past tree leaf-out. While it is possible that reductions in the snowpack and changes to microbial activity in the early spring may lead to asynchrony in the phenology of microbial relative to plant activity, it is at present uncertain whether and over what time scale this asynchrony may affect other forest ecosystem processes.

No need to breed for enhanced colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to improve low-P adaptation of West African sorghums	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Mycorrhiza; Sorghum; Phosphorus; Breeding; GWAS; Genetics; P efficiency	LAND-USE INTENSITY; TRIFOLIUM-SUBTERRANEUM; PHOSPHORUS ACQUISITION; CROPPING SYSTEMS; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; USE EFFICIENCY; GROWTH; ROOT; WHEAT; DIVERSITY	Aims Western Africa (WA) sorghums are predominantly cultivated under low plant available phosphorus (P) soil conditions with a diverse population of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) present. This study aims to determine whether sorghum breeding programs should target higher colonization by AMF through understanding the genotypic variation of sorghum for AMF-root colonization (AMF-RC) under different P-fertility conditions at different growth stages and assessing the genetics underlying AMF-RC using genome-wide association study (GWAS). Method A sorghum diversity panel of 187 WA genotypes was grown in low-P soil in a pot trial for 38 days and a subset of 13 genotypes was grown in a low- and high-P field until maturity at ICRISAT-Samanko in Mali, WA. Root samples were taken at 38 days from the pot trial plants and at flowering time in the field trials. Shoot biomass was analyzed for P concentration and dry matter yield. GWAS was conducted for shoot-P-content and AMF-RC. Results Significant genotypic variation was observed for AMF-RC, but the repeatability estimates were only low (w(2) = 0.15 at 38 days) to moderate (w(2) = 0.54-0.56 at flowering time). AMF-RC was significantly higher in low-P versus high-P field conditions. Large residual variation was observed for AMF-RC in both pot and field trials. None of the genotypic groups, contrasting for selection history, race and grain yield performance across multiple field trials, differed significantly for AMF-RC. AMF-RC showed no or negative relationships to shoot-P-content and grain yield, irrespective of soil-P level or plant developmental stage. AMF-RC at 38 days was significantly correlated (r = 67**) to AMF-RC at flowering. However, GWAS did not detect significant genomic regions for AMF-RC but did for shoot-P content. Conclusion Although genetic differences for AMF-RC were detected, the trait appears to be highly polygenic. Genotypic selection for higher AMF-RC in WA sorghums is not promising due to the low heritability and the lack of positive relationships with P acquisition.

However, the specific role of miR172 in legume nodulation is undefined. Ectopic expression of soybean miR172 resulted in an increase in nodule numbers in transgenic roots and an increase in the expression of both symbiotic leghemoglobin and nonsymbiotic hemoglobin. These nodules showed higher levels of nitrogenase activity. Further analysis revealed a complex regulatory circuit in which miR156 regulates miR172 expression and controls the level of an AP2 transcription factor. The latter, either directly or indirectly, controls the expression of nonsymbiotic hemoglobin, which is essential for regulating the levels of nodulation.

The field and lab trials were conducted in the research field and seed lab of the university of Tehran during 2007-2008. Treatments were various combinations of biofertilizers and seed primings. Seed mass, germination speed, germination percentage, germination synchrony, time to 50% germination, root dry weight, seedling dry weight, root length and seedling length were measured. Result showed that seed weight was affected by nearly all treatments. Except mycorrhizal fungus, all other treatments had higher Seed weight than control. Higher seed weight value was obtained with Osmo-priming+phosphate solubilizing fungus compared to control (287.5 and 208.7 g/1000-seed, respectively). Germination percentages were higher in seeds from plants treated with phosphate solubilizing microorganisms than control. All treatments with Osmo-priming in their combinations had higher seed weight than control. Some significant correlations were found among seed properties.

An alternative to reduce and optimize NF to wheat is to inoculate with endophytic promoting growth bacteria (EPGB), as genus Burkholderia cepacia and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus able to improve radical uptake of NF, its suggesting by inducing synthesis of growth promoting vegetal substances (GPVS). The aim of this research was to evaluate the inoculation of Burkholderia cepacia and Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus on phenology and biomass of T. aestivum at 50% dose of NF. A trial in greenhouse condition wasconducted inoculating seed T. aestivum's with both EPGB by measuring its phenology: (PH) plant height, (RL) root length and biomass: total fresh weight (TFW) and dry (TDW) at seedling and flowering stages. Results showed a positive effect of B. cepacia in wheat on its TDW with 0.61g value statistically significant compared to 0.53g TDW of wheat used as relative control fed with NF 100% dose (RC). B. cepacia and G. diazotrophicus inoculated to wheat had a positive increased on its TDW with 4.23 g value statistically significant compared to 1.13 g TDW of wheat used as RC. Conclusion suggested that B. cepacia and G. diazotrophicus by synthetized GPVS had a positive effect on wheat growth at reduced dose of NF.

Their Cmp(-) phenotype was repeatedly displayed in sterile plant tests, where competitiveness was measured against a Fix(-) reference strain CXM1-48 and the parental strain CXM1-105. In addition mutant T37 showed a decreased nodulation rate (Nra(-)) at the early stages of alfalfa development (9-18 days after germination), Its mutant phenotype was demonstrated also under greenhouse conditions when it was evaluated against reference strain CXM1-48, and against indigenous rhizobial strains persisting in the soil. Tn5 insertions from mutants T37 and T107 were transduced using phage phi M12 to the parental strain CXM1-105. All tested transductants showed Cmp(-) and Nra(-) phenotype in the case of T37 and Cmp(-) phenotype in the case of T107. By means of conjugations with avirulent R. meliloti mutant ZB121 and plasmidless Agrobacterium tumefaciens UBAPF2 we located both Tn5-insertions on the R. meliloti Sym-plasmid.

The time taken for a new resistant mutant to reach a population size that is unlikely to die out by chance is called emergence time. Prolonging emergence time would delay loss of control. We investigate the effect of fungicide dose on the emergence time in fungal plant pathogens. A population dynamical model is combined with dose response data for Zymoseptoria tritici, an important wheat pathogen. Fungicides suppress sensitive pathogen population. This has two effects. First, the rate of appearance of resistant mutants is reduced, hence the emergence takes longer. Second, more healthy host tissue becomes available for resistant mutants, increasing their chances to invade and accelerates emergence. In theory, the two competing effects may lead to a non-monotonic dependence of the emergence time on fungicide dose that exhibits a minimum. But according to field data, fungicides are unable to reduce the fungicide-sensitive population strongly enough even at high doses. Hence, for full resistance over realistic ranges of pathogen's life history and fungicide dose-response parameters, emergence time decreases monotonically with increasing dose. For partial resistance, there can be cases within a limited parameter range, when emergence decelerates at higher doses.

With regard to mediating plant insect interactions, it has become apparent that symbiotic microbes are of fundamental importance. However, elucidation of the roles of symbiotic microbes in these systems has been hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding microbial community structure; with fungi, in particular, being understudied components of symbiont assemblages. Here, we present one of the first studies to characterize fungi associated with each life history stage of a lepidopteran herbivore (egg, larva, pupa, and adult) and the leaves of its host plant We used a culture-independent approach and explored the possibility that plant-associated fungi may colonize butterflies. The fungal assemblage recovered from each butterfly life history stage was a subset of the fungi that occurred on host plant leaves. The most diverse fungal assemblage recovered from a butterfly life history stage was associated with eggs of wild caught females. Because fungi recovered from all butterfly life history stages were also found on host plant tissues, our study raises the possibility that butterflies could disperse fungi between individual plants. Additionally, we observed a marked reduction in fungal diversity during pupation. As one of the first studies examining the fungal microbiome of a holometabolous insect throughout its life history, our results highlight the diversity of fungi associated with insect herbivores and their hosts and suggest possibilities for further work examining plant insect fungal interactions.

Illyarrie) was studied in field-grown plants. Plants inoculated at the seedling stage (2 days post-emergence) showed 45% mortality. Plants infected through the seed were more stunted than plants inoculated at the seedling stage. Plants inoculated up to the mid-vegetative growth stage (58 days post-emergence) yielded less-than-or-equal-to 27% of the dry matter and less-than-or-equal-to 9% of the seed of healthy plants. Late inoculation (114 days post-emergence) did not affect dry matter yield, but reduced seed yield to 75% of that of healthy plants. Rate of seed transmission depended on the time of inoculation of plants. The maximum rate was 24.5% for plants that were inoculated at the mid-vegetative growth stage (58 days post-emergence). However, early inoculation caused a large reduction in seed yield, and it was shown that plants inoculated at the beginning of flowering (94 days post-emergence) produced greater numbers of infected progeny than plants inoculated at earlier or later times. No relationship was observed between seed weight and transmission of CMV. Infectious CMV was recovered from the embryo, but not from the testa. A simple seed transmission model was used to evaluate several hypothetical epidemics and to determine the time of inoculation which results in greatest rates of seed transmission of CMV. For example, when fewer than 73% of plants in a crop become infected with CMV, then the rate of transmission of virus in crop seeds will be greatest when inoculations are at the beginning of flowering.

The Influence of Altered Rainfall Regimes on Early Season N Partitioning Among Early Phenology Annual Plants, a Late Phenology Shrub, and Microbes in a Semi-arid Ecosystem	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						nitrogen; rainfall; semi-arid; phenology; climate change; microbe; plant	SOIL-NITROGEN; WATER PULSES; TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS; SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; DIFFUSION TECHNIQUE; ORGANIC-MATTER; CARBON; DYNAMICS; PRECIPITATION; VEGETATION	In Mediterranean-type ecosystems, nitrogen (N) accumulates in soil during dry summer months and rapidly becomes available during early season rain events. The availability of early season N could depend on the size of rainfall events, soil microbial activity, and phenology of the plant community. However, it is poorly understood how precipitation patterns affect the fate of early season N. Microbes and plants with early phenology may compete strongly for early season N but theory suggests that microbial N storage can meet plant N demands later in the season. Using a N-15 tracer and rainfall manipulation we investigated the fate of early season N. N allocation patterns differed substantially between microbes, early and late phenology plants. As expected early phenology annuals and microbes took up N-15, within 1 day, whereas a late-phenology shrub allocated N-15 to leaves later in the season. We saw no evidence for microbial storage of early season N; the peak of N-15 in shrub leaves did not coincide with detectable levels of N-15 in the microbial biomass or labile soil pool. This suggests that shrubs were able to access early season N, store and allocate it for growth later in the season. Although we saw no evidence of microbial N storage, N retention in soil organic matter (SOM) was high and microbes may play an important role in sequestering N to SOM. Plant N uptake did not respond significantly to 1 year of rainfall manipulation, but microbes were sensitive to dry conditions. 1 year after N-15 addition shrubs had resorbed up to half of the N from leaves whereas N in annuals remained as dead leaf litter. Differences in end-of-season N partitioning between dead and living biomass in the two vegetation types suggest that plant species composition could affect N availability in the following growing season, but it may take several years of altered precipitation patterns to produce rainfall-dependent changes.

There are numerous application areas of ozone in food industry such as sanitation of food plant equipments, surface hygiene and reuse of waste water. While the application of ozone for dried fruits disinfection and for fresh fruits and vegetables microflora destruction has been studied extensively, relatively little information is available on the potential of ozone to reduce microbial populations in date fruits. In this study, ozone was applied in gas form at three concentrations (1, 3, and 5 ppm) for four different periods (15, 30, 45 and 60 min) on Iranian date fruits and the reduction in the total bacterial count, Coliform, Staphylococcus aureus as well as yeast/mold counts were examined. The promising results indicated the efficacy of ozone to reduce the microbial populations in date fruits. Escherichia coli and S. aureus were not found on cultured plates inoculated with the treated samples after treatment with 5 ppm (p < 0.05) in 60 min.

We hypothesized that Gigaspora margarita Becker and Hall would be more affected by soil disturbance than Glomus clarum Nicol. and Schenck, and consequently, the tripartite symbiosis would develop more rapidly and lead to greater N-2 fixation in the presence of the latter. Soil pasteurization allowed the establishment of treatments with individual AMF species and soil disturbance enabled the development of contrasting root colonization potentials. In contrast, the colonization potential of B. japonicum was kept the same in all treatments. Soil disturbance significantly reduced root colonization by both AMF, with Gi. margarita being considerably more affected than G. clarum. Furthermore, the tripartite symbiosis progressed faster with G. clarum, and at 10 days after plant emergence, there was 30% more nodules when G. clarum was present compared to that when the bacterial symbiont alone was present. At flowering, the absence of soil disturbance stimulated N-2 fixation by 17% in mycorrhizal plants. However, this response was similar for both AMF.

However, the fugitive life history of this species might have evolved at the expense of investing in capacity to steer an extensive rhizosphere effect. To determine whether the rhizosphere effect of Arabidopsis is different from other plant species that have a less fugitive life history, we compared the root microbiome of Arabidopsis to eight other, later succession plant species from the same habitat. The study included molecular analysis of soil, rhizosphere, and endorhizosphere microbiome both from the field and from a laboratory experiment. Molecular analysis revealed that the rhizosphere effect (as quantified by the number of enriched and depleted bacterial taxa) was similar to 35% lower than the average of the other eight species. Nevertheless, there are numerous microbial taxa differentially abundant between soil and rhizosphere, and they represent for a large part the rhizosphere effects of the other plants. In the case of fungal taxa, the number of differentially abundant taxa in the Arabidopsis rhizosphere is 10% of the other species' average. In the plant endorhizosphere, which is generally more selective, the rhizosphere effect of Arabidopsis is comparable to other species, both for bacterial and fungal taxa. Taken together, our data imply that the rhizosphere effect of the Arabidopsis is smaller in the rhizosphere, but equal in the endorhizosphere when compared to plant species with a less fugitive life history.

Life history traits of the aphids measured were nymphal development time, teneral adult weight, growth rate, total fecundity, adult longevity and duration of postreproductive life. For both aphids in both generations, mycorrhizal colonization increased aphid weight and fecundity, while other traits were unaffected. The increases were consistent between generations. In a second experiment, M. persicae was reared on plants with and without the fungus, under varying N and P regimes. The results of N addition were inconclusive because there was high aphid mortality. However, under P supplementation, positive effects of the mycorrhiza on aphid growth were seen at low and medium P levels, while at high P levels these effects disappeared. The positive effects of mycorrhizal colonization reported here are contrary to the majority of previous studies with chewing insects, which have reported negative effects. A number of possible mechanisms for this apparent discrepancy are discussed.

For herbivores, plant quality and variation in chemical plant defences can maintain genetic variation in performance. Apart from plant secondary compounds, symbiosis between plants and endosymbiotic fungi (endophytes) can produce herbivore-toxic compounds. We show that there is significant variation among aphid genotypes in response to endophytes by comparing life-history traits of 37 clones of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi feeding on endophyte-free and endophyte-infected tall fescue Lolium arundinaceum. Clonal variation for life-history traits was large, and most clones performed better on endophyte-free plants. However, the clones differed in the relative performance across the two environments, resulting in significant genotype x environment interactions for all reproductive traits. These findings suggest that natural variation in prevalence of endophyte infection can contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity in aphid populations.	[Haerri, S.

In this chapter, a protocol for establishing protocorm-fungi culture using a seed baiting technique is detailed. This technique enables the identification of potential mycorrhizal fungi specifically at the time of seed germination and during protocorm development.

In the present study, surface sterilized onion seeds were sown in earthen pots filled with sterile soil. Half the pots were inoculated with sterilized arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spores and sterilized inoculated maize root fragments and another half without any AMF inoculation represented control but were provided sterilized maize root fragments having no AMF colonization. After 40 days of germination, the inoculated plants along with their controls were sampled at 20, 40, 60 and 80 days of growth. The bulbs of onion plant are shown to present a higher level of metabolites like carbohydrates, protein and phenolics, and mineral nutrition in the mycorrhizal ones as compared to the non-inoculated ones. The HPLC analysis depicted that indigestible oligosaccharides are increased due to AMP inoculation.

For each plant species, root diameters, root fibrousness, root to shoot ratio, plant dry weight, mycorrhizal root colonization, mycorrhizal dependence, P dependence, and phenology were measured. Using these data, cluster analysis, stepwise discriminant analysis, and canonical discriminant analysis of the data revealed that the forbs could be divided into three distinct groups based on mycorrhizal dependence, root morphology, and phenology in descending order of importance. Cluster groups 1 and 2 contained obligately and facultatively mycotrophic forbs, respectively, while the third group did not benefit from the symbiosis. Models for prediction of mycorrhizal dependence, constructed using stepwise regression analysis, were based largely on root fibrousness. A regression analysis comparing mycorrhizal dependence and root fibrousness was conducted, and group means and 95 % confidence ellipses were examined for each group. These revealed that the mycorrhizal dependence and root fibrousness of groups 1 and 3 are relatively constant regardless of P level, while the response of forbs of group 2 is more plastic, i.e., mycorrhizal dependence decreases and root fibrousness increases as P level increases. The relationship between plant response to mycorrhizal symbiosis and life strategy or growth pattern is discussed.

It was expected that dogwood fruits (Cornus drummondii) would be affected by microbes to a greater degree than ash seed (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) or redbud seed (Cercis canadensis). Results revealed a change in microbial populations over time but dogwood fruit was no more liable to microbial infestation than seeds. One bacterial species was found in high number on all three food types while three species were found on only two of the three foods. Microbial populations from all three test items increased from November to january but March populations were not different from November populations. It is suggested that climatic factors help to control microbial populations on cache foods.

The inoculation by spraying on coveting increased nodulation and plant dry matter in the 45 and 60 DAE. It also increased significantly grain yield and N content, similarly to N fertilization treatment, and was superior to the control, and inferior to the standard inoculation related to grain yield.

The parents and their progenies were evaluated in the greenhouse for resistance to the spread of scab within a spike. A central floret was inoculated by injecting a droplet of inoculum at the time of anthesis. Inoculated plants were kept in a moist chamber for three subsequent nights. The proportion of scabbed spikelets was recorded six-times from 3-days to 21-days after inoculation, and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated from these proportions. One to three genes, depending on the cultivar, conditioned resistance to scab as reflected by the AUDPC. A simple additive-dominance effect model fitted the segregation data for 8 of the 11 crosses. Dominance and epistatic effects were significant in a few crosses. These effects increased resistance in some crosses but decreased resistance in others. However, relative to additive effects, dominant and epistatic effects accounted for only a small portion of the genetic effects in the populations evaluated. The importance of additive effects means that it should be possible to accumulate different genes to enhance resistance to scab in wheat.

Management of flower infection in this pathosystem relies on multiple fungicide applications during bloom. However, flowers that open between spray applications may remain prone to infection because the stigmatic surface (infection court) is not exposed to active ingredient, unless there is systemic movement in the pistil and/or eradicant activity in the ovary. To quantify and compare pre- and post-infection fungicidal activity in flowers, we examine here the ability of two systemic fungicides to prevent flower infection and subsequent fruit colonization by M. vaccinii-corymbosi. The fungicides were applied before or after anthesis (first day of open bloom) in an experimental system where flower development stages and inoculation timing were monitored and controlled precisely. In greenhouse experiments with potted rabbiteye blueberry plants, treatment with fenbuconazole, triforine, or water was made when sufficient numbers of flower clusters at anthesis and earlier pre-anthesis stages were present simultaneously. Treated flowers (n = 10,992) were tagged, observed daily, and individual flowers were pollinated and inoculated 1 day after opening. Fruit from treated flowers were assessed for incidence and severity of mummification. Both fungicides provided excellent protection to newly opened flowers that were at the anthesis stage during fungicide application, but differed in their activity in unopened flowers at pre-anthesis stages during application. Fenbuconazole suppressed infection in unopened flowers that were on average 2.5 days pre-anthesis at the time of application, whereas triforine provided substantial protection to earlier flower stages up to 6.5 days pre-anthesis. In a separate experiment to quantify post-infection activity (n = 13,068 flowers), fenbuconazole and triforine significantly suppressed fruit mummification when applied within 2 and 5 days after anthesis, respectively (with inoculation and pollination 1 day after anthesis). Thus, the total window of activity of fenbuconazole in blueberry flowers was 4.5 days, whereas that of triforine was at least 11.5 days. Prevention of ovary colonization by eradicant activity appeared to be the predominant mode for superior activity of triforine against M. vaccinii-corymbosi in flowers. To better manage flower infection by this pathogen, active ingredients such as triforine with superior activity in floral tissues need to be identified and characterized. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	46	AO	Denison, RF				Denison, RF			Legume sanctions and the evolution of symbiotic cooperation by rhizobia	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						mutualism; symbiosis; kin selection; plant strategies; nodule O(2); permeability	POLY-BETA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE; PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT; SOYBEAN ROOT-NODULES; NITROGENASE ACTIVITY; GLYCINE-MAX; OXYGEN CONCENTRATION; JAPONICUM STRAIN; MEDICAGO-SATIVA; FIX NITROGEN; ACID CONTENT	The legume-rhizobium symbiosis is an ideal model for studying the factors that limit the evolution of microbial mutualists into parasites. Legumes are unable to consistently recognize parasitic rhizobia that, once established inside plant cells, use plant resources for their own reproduction rather than for N(2) fixation. Evolution of parasitism in rhizobia, driven partly by competition among multiple rhizobial strains infecting the same plant, may be countered by postinfection legume sanctions. Both the biochemical options for rhizobial cheating and the evolutionary effect of legume sanctions depend on differences in rhizobial life history associated with nodule type. In legumes with determinate nodule growth, rhizobia typically retain the ability to reproduce after differentiating into N(2)-fixing bacteroids. Sanctions against individual bacteroids (e.g., acid hydrolases) would therefore select for cooperative rhizobia. In nodules with indeterminate growth, bacteroids generally lose the ability to reproduce, so legume sanctions against bacteroids would have no effect on rhizobial evolution. Whole-nodule sanctions (e.g., decreased nodule O(2) permeability) could be effective, via kin selection of undifferentiated rhizobia that persist in indeterminate nodules and replenish soil populations after nodule senescence. Mixed nodules could reduce the effectiveness of whole-nodule sanctions. The frequency of mixed nodules under field conditions is unknown.

Effect of composted textile sludge on growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation of soybean and cowpea	BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						industrial wastes; nitrogen fertilization; symbiosis; glutamine synthetase	SOILS	The effect of composted textile sludge on growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation of soybean and cowpea was evaluated in a greenhouse experiment. The compost was incorporated into soil at 0, 9.5, 19 and 38 t ha(-1) (bases upon the N requirement of the crops, i.e., 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg available N ha(-1)). Growth, nodulation and shoot accumulation of nitrogen were evaluated 36 and 63 days after plant emergence. Nodule glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and leghemoglobin content were evaluated 63 days after emergence. Composted textile sludge did not show negative effects on nodule number and weight, nodule GS activity and leghemoglobin content. Nitrogen accumulation in shoot dry matter in soybean and cowpea was higher than other treatments with application of 19 t ha(-1) of compost. Composting can be an alternate technology for the management of solid textile mill sludge. This study verifies that the composted textile sludge was not harmful to growth, nodulation and nitrogen fixation of soybean and cowpea. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some of these fungi isolated from the infected plants in date palm orchards were identified as Aspergillus niger and Rhizophus oryzae. These fungi cause fruit loss during later stages of maturation and are responsible for severe post-harvest losses of date fruit. They may also deteriorate the overall health of plants. The fungal culture filtrates (FCF) from A. niger (ANFCF) and R. oryzae (ROFCF) were prepared and used as elicitors for the experimentation. These FCFs were foliar sprayed on the date palm plants in the field after the fruit set. Various quality attributes such as weight, firmness and total soluble solids and biochemical properties like total sugars, total proteins, total phenols, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity of fresh date fruit (khalal stage) harvested from the FCF treated and untreated plants were studied. The fruit harvested from plants treated with ROFCF showed enhanced levels of total sugar, total proteins, ascorbic acid, and DPPH scavenging activities followed by the fruit from plants treated with ANFCF in comparison to fruit collected from untreated plants. The shelf life of fruit from plants treated with ROFCF and ANFCF increased beyond 14 d at room temperature while the fruit from untreated plants started to deteriorate after 7 d from harvest. The study indicates that the use of fungal culture filtrates as elicitors can help the plant to build up its defense mechanism by elevating the activity of protective enzymes like, Peroxidase (POX), Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). It also enhances the growth of plant and improve the quality as well as increases shelf life of fruit.

Effect on nodulation	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article								Two field experiments were conducted, one in Vicosa, Brazil (high fertility soil), and the other in Coimbra, Brazil (low fertility soil) to verify the effect molybdenum (Mo), nitrogen (N), or Rhizobium on growth of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Plants were either given a foliar application of 40 g Mo ha(-1), or an addition of N fertilizer (20 kg ha(-1) at planting and/or 30 kg ha(-1) as a side dressing), or inoculated with two selected Rhizobium strains. Nodulation parameters of common bean (cv. Ouro Negro 1992) were measured. At both sites, Mo application at 25 days after plant emergence decreased nodule number per plant, while nodule weight was not affected in Vicosa and was increased in Coimbra at 46 days after plant emergence. However, N application at planting decreased the number and the weight of nodules at both sites, while N side dressed did not affect nodule number or weight. Therefore, the main effect of Mo fertilization was an increase in the size of nodules. The main effect of Mo on nodulation appears to be the avoidance of nodule senescence, and so maintaining a longer period of effective N-2 fixation.

The growth and survival of herbivores which feed on plants could, as a consequence, also be affected by these mutualistic soil fungi. Consequently, interactions between AMF, plants and herbivores could occur. To test this, larvae of the common blue butterfly, Polyommatus icarus (Lycaenidae), were fed with sprigs of Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) plants which were inoculated with one of two different AMF species, with a mixture of these AMF species or with sprigs of plants which were not inoculated with AMF Survival and larval weight of third instar larvae fed with plants colonised by AMF were greater than those of larvae fed with non-mycorrhizal plants. Survival of larvae feeding on non-mycorrhizal plants was 1.6 times lower than that of larvae feeding on plants inoculated with a mixture of AMF species and 3.8 times lower than that of larvae feeding on plants inoculated with single AMF species. Furthermore, larvae fed with non-mycorrhizal plants attained only about half the weight of larvae fed with mycorrhizal plants after 11 days of growth. These differences in larval performance might be explained by differences in leaf chemistry, since mycorrhizal plants had a 3 times higher leaf P concentration and a higher C/N-ratio. Our results, thus, show that the presence of belowground mutualistic soil fungi influences the performance of aboveground herbivores by altering their food quality. Larval consumption, larval food use and adult lipid concentrations of the common blue butterfly differed between larvae which were fed with plants inoculated with different AMF species. This suggests that the performance of herbivores is not only influenced by the presence of AMF but also depends on the identity of the AMF species colonising the host plants. Moreover, a significant interaction term between AMF species and maternal identity of the larvae occurred for adult dry weight, indicating that the performance of offspring from different females was differently influenced by AMF species composition. To our knowledge, these results show for the first time that the species composition of AMF communities can influence life-history traits of butterfly larvae and possibly herbivores in general.

In the greenhouse, potted blueberry plants having flower clusters at five distinct stages (from bud scale separation to anthesis) were treated with the two fungicides. One day after anthesis (between 1 and 15 days after fungicide treatment), individual flowers were detached and inoculated with conidia of M. vaccinii-corymbosi in the laboratory. Four days after inoculation, hyphal ingress into the style was determined microscopically as a measure of fungicide efficacy. Results revealed a significant flower stage effect (P < 0.0001), whereby only fungicide application at anthesis but not at the four preanthesis stages reduced subsequent fungal ingress into the style. There was no significant difference between the two fungicides (P > 0.50) nor was there a significant fungicide-flower stage interaction (P > 0.30). In the field during 2 years, mature blueberry plants were treated with the two fungicides and exposed to natural pathogen inoculum. At the time of application, flower clusters at anthesis and at three preanthesis stages were selected and tagged. Mummy berry incidence in fruit developing from the tagged clusters was assessed to determine treatment effects. Whereas fenbuconazole lowered disease incidence for all preanthesis stages, azoxystrobin was effective only at the latest preanthesis stage. The discrepancy between these results and those of the greenhouse study (where there was no preanthesis activity of either fungicide) indirectly suggests post-infection fungicidal activity in the ovary, the base of which was exposed to the fungicide spray at the time of treatment for all flower phenology stages. Thus, although there appears to be insufficient translocation of the two fungicides in flowers treated at preanthesis stages to prevent stylar ingress by the pathogen, fungicidal activity in the ovary may be sufficient to halt subsequent fungal colonization, especially for fenbuconazole. To prescribe the most effective management program for flower-infecting fungi, translocation and post-infection activity of fungicides in floral tissues must be better understood.	[Tarnowski, T. L.

Still, relatively little is known about the effects of the mycorrhizal symbiosis on host plant reproduction. Common limitations to reproduction include nutrient deficiency, herbivory and disease, and mycorrhizal fungi can influence each of these. Several aspects of sexual reproduction may be influenced by colonization of mycorrhizal fungi including the timing of reproductive events, the number of inflorescences per plant, the number of flowers per inflorescence, the amount of pollen per flower, the proportion of flowers producing fruits, and the number of seeds per fruit. Seed quality can also be strongly influenced by colonization of mycorrhizal fungi, resulting in variation in seedling vigor and resultant competitive ability. Because infection by mycorrhizal fungi can influence interactions among plants, it may lead to variation among individuals in their contributions to the next generation and, therefore, may control the genetic structures of populations and communities.

In the present study, earthen pots containing autoclaved soil were taken in which surface sterilized potato seeds were sown. The seed sowed earthen pots were inoculated by sterilized spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi along with sterilized inoculated maize-root fragments, while the rest half of the seed filled pots, without any inoculation depicting control but were provided with non-inoculated maize root fragments. The inoculation was performed twice; first inoculation was done 3 days prior to sowing of potato seeds and second at the time of seedling emergence. Sampling of the inoculated as well as of control plants was performed at 20-day intervals till 80 days after tuber initiation. An increment in the level of metabolites as well as mineral nutrient was found in mycorrhizal inoculated potato tubers in contrast to non-inoculated. Our work demonstrates that inoculation has a great potential in enriching storage metabolites and nutrients in potato plant in low yielding soils.

This research work evaluated the effects of both PGPR and AMF on bell pepper and jalapeno pepper plants. Five bacterial strains isolated from several locations in Estado de Mexico were used: [P61 (Pseudomonas tolaasii), A46 (P tolaasii), R44 (Bacillus pumilus), BSP1.1 (Paenibacillus sp.), and OLs-Sf5 (Pseudomonas sp.)], and three treatments with AMF [H1 (consortium isolated from pepper crops in the State of Puebla), H2 (Rhizophagus intraradices), and H3 (consortium isolated from the rhizosphere of lemon trees, State of Tabasco)]. In addition, a fertilized treatment (Steiner nutrient solution at 25%) and an unfertilized control were included. Seedlings of Caloro jalapeno pepper and California Wonder bell pepper were inoculated with AMF at seed sowing, and PGPR were inoculated after 15 days of seedling emergence; seedlings were grown under plant growth chamber conditions.

Disturbance changes arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal phenology and soil glomalin concentrations but not fungal spore composition in montane rainforests in Veracruz and Chiapas, Mexico	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						glomalin; MAb32B11 immunoreactive soil protein; Mycorrhizal fungi; Mexico; Montane rainforest; sporulation; phenology; disturbance	TROPICAL FOREST; AGGREGATE STABILITY; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; LAND-USE; PROTEIN; HOST; COMMUNITIES; CARBON; HYPHAE; QUANTIFICATION	Mexican montane rainforests and adjacent disturbed areas were studied for disturbance-related spatio-temporal changes to the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) community and soil glomalin concentration. The AMF community functions to both improve plant growth and soil conditions and is thus an important component to the restoration of this forest type to disturbed areas. The study areas included mature rainforests that were converted to pine forests, milpas, pastures and shrub/herbaceous plant communities via burning and logging. Seasonal patterns in AMF spore species richness and sporulation significantly differed across disturbance types at two of the three sites surveyed. Contrasting patterns of sporulation among AMF families across different disturbance types helped to explain how species richness and composition were maintained despite dramatic changes to the host plant community. Meaning, in most cases, disturbance induced changes in when different AMF taxa sporulated but not what taxa sporulated. Only conversion from mature pine-oak-Liquidambar-Persea forests to pine-dominated stands severely reduced AMF spore richness and total sporulation. Surprisingly, in pine-dominant stands no concomitant negative impacts on soil glomalin (MAb32B11 immunoreactive soil protein) concentrations were detected. However, soils of mature forests containing no pines had the highest concentration of glomalin. Conversion to pasture and milpa (diverse cornfield) had a strong negative impact on the concentration of soil glomalin concentrations. In sharp contrast, the same disturbance types improved AMF sporulation and AMF spore richness. It appears that disturbance type, and not AMF community measures used herein, best predicts changes in soil glomalin concentration. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We focused on two phenotypic traits that are not functionally linked: flowering time and perception of symbiotic microbes. Phenology is an important fitness component, especially for annual plants, and many instances of molecular adaptation have been reported for genes involved in flowering pathways. While perception of symbiotic microbes is also integral to adaptation in many plant species, very few reports of molecular adaptation exist for symbiotic genes. Here we used data from 57 individuals and 53 gene fragments to quantify the overall strength of both positive and purifying selection in M. truncatula and asked if footprints of positive selection can be detected at key genes of rhizobia recognition pathways. Results: We examined nucleotide variation among 57 accessions from natural populations in 53 gene fragments: 5 genes involved in nitrogen-fixing bacteria recognition, 11 genes involved in flowering, and 37 genes used as control loci. We detected 1757 polymorphic sites yielding an average nucleotide diversity (pi) of 0.003 per site. Non-synonymous variation is under sizable purifying selection with 90% of amino-acid changing mutations being strongly selected against. Accessions were structured in two groups consistent with geographical origins. Each of these two groups harboured an excess of rare alleles, relative to expectations of a constant-sized population, suggesting recent population expansion. Using coalescent simulations and an approximate Bayesian computation framework we detected several instances of genes departing from selective neutrality within each group and showed that the polymorphism of two nodulation and four flowering genes has probably been shaped by recent positive selection. Conclusion: We quantify the intensity of purifying selection in the M. truncatula genome and show that putative footprints of natural selection can be detected at different time scales in both flowering and symbiotic pathways.

There were significant variations in excisable nodulation (range 0-22 nodules/plant), dry matter (DM) yields of leaf (17.1-143.9 g/plant) and stem (15.2-161.2 g/plant) but not in days to first flowering (63-85 days). The mean nitrogen concentration in leaf (4% DM) was twice that in stem (1.9%). Mean neutral detergent fibre (41.8%) and acid detergent fibre (29.6%) concentrations in leaf were 20 percentage units lower than that of stem, whereas the in vitro dry matter digestibility of the leaf (64.4%) was 20 percentage units higher than that of stem. There was little variation in the level of acid detergent lignin between leaf and stem. The concentrations of soluble phenolics and insoluble proanthocyanidins were also slightly higher in leaf than in stem. Overall, Accessions 1042, 1089, 1067, 1045 and 1071 were consistently higher yielding, irrespective of the available moisture. They have potential for use as a feed supplement in semiarid parts of Kenya.

A multivariate analysis of variation in genome size and endoreduplication in angiosperms reveals strong phylogenetic signal and association with phenotypic traits	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						endopolyploidy; endoreduplication; genome size; multivariate analysis; nucleotype; phenotype; phylogenetic canonical correlation analysis (PCCA)	NUCLEAR-DNA CONTENT; FLOW-CYTOMETRIC ESTIMATION; CELL-SIZE; R-PACKAGE; EVOLUTION; ENDOPOLYPLOIDY; STRATEGIES; TISSUE; PLANTS; ORGAN	Genome size (C-value) and endopolyploidy (endoreduplication index, EI) are known to correlate with various morphological and ecological traits, in addition to phylogenetic placement. A phylogenetically controlled multivariate analysis was used to explore the relationships between DNA content and phenotype in angiosperms. Seeds from 41 angiosperm species (17 families) were grown in a common glasshouse experiment. Genome size (2C-value and 1Cx-value) and EI (in four tissues: leaf, stem, root, petal) were determined using flow cytometry. The phylogenetic signal was calculated for each measure of DNA content, and phylogenetic canonical correlation analysis (PCCA) explored how the variation in genome size and EI was correlated with 18 morphological and ecological traits. Phylogenetic signal (lambda) was strongest for EI in all tissues, and lambda was stronger for the 2C-value than the 1Cx-value. PCCA revealed that EI was correlated with pollen length, stem height, seed mass, dispersal mechanism, arbuscular mycorrhizal association, life history and flowering time, and EI and genome size were both correlated with stem height and life history. PCCA provided an effective way to explore multiple factors of DNA content variation and phenotypic traits in a phylogenetic context. Traits that were correlated significantly with DNA content were linked to plant competitive ability.

(Coleoptera: Scolytidae) in Lithuania: occurrence, phenology, morphology and communities of associated fungi	BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						spruce; climate change; fungi; symbiosis; forest pests; microorganisms; bark beetle	PREDATORS; PINICOLA; REGION	We studied the occurrence, morphology and phenology of Dendroctonus micans in Lithuania and the fungi associated with the beetle at different developmental stages. The occurrence of D. micans was assessed in 19 seed orchards (at least 40 years old) of Picea abies (L. Karst.) situated in different parts of the country. Bark beetle phenology was studied in two sites: a seed orchard of P. abies and a plantation of Picea pungens (Engelm.). D. micans morphology was assessed under the dissection microscope using individuals at different developmental stages that were sampled during phenology observations. Communities of fungi associated with D. micans were studied using both fungal culturing methods and direct high-throughput sequencing from D. micans. Results showed that the incidence D. micans was relatively rare and D. micans was mainly detected in central and eastern Lithuania. The life cycle included the following stages: adult, egg, I-V developmental stage larvae and pupa. However, development of D. micans was quicker and its nests larger under the bark of P. pungens than of P. abies, indicating the effect of the host species. Fungal culturing and direct high-throughput sequencing revealed that D. micans associated fungi communities were species rich and dominated by yeasts from a class Saccharomycetes. In total, 319 fungal taxa were sequenced, among which Peterozyma toletana (37.5% of all fungal sequences), Yamadazyma scolyti (30.0%) and Kuraishia capsulate (17.7%) were the most common. Plant pathogens and blue stain fungi were also detected suggesting their potentially negative effects to both tree health and timber quality.

We used a suite of approaches to analyze the structure and functional characteristics of soil microbial communities from replicated plots in two long-term N fertilization experiments located in contrasting systems. Pyrosequencing-based analyses of 16S rRNA genes revealed no significant effects of N fertilization on bacterial diversity, but significant effects on community composition at both sites; copiotrophic taxa (including members of the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes phyla) typically increased in relative abundance in the high N plots, with oligotrophic taxa (mainly Acidobacteria) exhibiting the opposite pattern. Consistent with the phylogenetic shifts under N fertilization, shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed increases in the relative abundances of genes associated with DNA/RNA replication, electron transport and protein metabolism, increases that could be resolved even with the shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing conducted here (average of 75 000 reads per sample). We also observed shifts in the catabolic capabilities of the communities across the N gradients that were significantly correlated with the phylogenetic and metagenomic responses, indicating possible linkages between the structure and functioning of soil microbial communities. Overall, our results suggest that N fertilization may, directly or indirectly, induce a shift in the predominant microbial life-history strategies, favoring a more active, copiotrophic microbial community, a pattern that parallels the often observed replacement of K-selected with r-selected plant species with elevated N.

To date, GWAS have generally relied on relatively sparse sampling of nucleotide diversity, which is likely to bias results by preferentially sampling high-frequency SNPs not in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with causative SNPs. To avoid these limitations we conducted GWAS with >6 million SNPs identified by sequencing the genomes of 226 accessions of the model legume Medicago truncatula. We used these data to identify candidate genes and the genetic architecture underlying phenotypic variation in plant height, trichome density, flowering time, and nodulation. The characteristics of candidate SNPs differed among traits, with candidates for flowering time and trichome density in distinct clusters of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of candidates underlying variation in flowering time and height significantly greater than MAF of candidates underlying variation in other traits. Candidate SNPs tagged several characterized genes including nodulation related genes SERK2, MtnodGRP3, MtMMPL1, NFP, CaML3, MtnodGRP3A and flowering time gene MtFD as well as uncharacterized genes that become candidates for further molecular characterization. By comparing sequence-based candidates to candidates identified by in silico 250K SNP arrays, we provide an empirical example of how reliance on even high-density reduced representation genomic makers can bias GWAS results. Depending on the trait, only 30-70% of the top 20 in silico array candidates were within 1 kb of sequence-based candidates. Moreover, the sequence-based candidates tagged by array candidates were heavily biased towards common variants; these comparisons underscore the need for caution when interpreting results from GWAS conducted with sparsely covered genomes.

Microbial dormancy improves development and experimental validation of ecosystem model	ISME JOURNAL			English	Article							CARBON-USE EFFICIENCY; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; THERMAL ADAPTATION; THEORETICAL-MODEL; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; DECOMPOSITION; RESPIRATION	Climate feedbacks from soils can result from environmental change followed by response of plant and microbial communities, and/or associated changes in nutrient cycling. Explicit consideration of microbial life-history traits and functions may be necessary to predict climate feedbacks owing to changes in the physiology and community composition of microbes and their associated effect on carbon cycling. Here we developed the microbial enzyme-mediated decomposition (MEND) model by incorporating microbial dormancy and the ability to track multiple isotopes of carbon. We tested two versions of MEND, that is, MEND with dormancy (MEND) and MEND without dormancy (MEND_wod), against long-term (270 days) carbon decomposition data from laboratory incubations of four soils with isotopically labeled substrates. MEND_wod adequately fitted multiple observations (total C-CO2 and C-14-CO2 respiration, and dissolved organic carbon), but at the cost of significantly underestimating the total microbial biomass. MEND improved estimates of microbial biomass by 20-71% over MEND_wod. We also quantified uncertainties in parameters and model simulations using the Critical Objective Function Index method, which is based on a global stochastic optimization algorithm, as well as model complexity and observational data availability. Together our model extrapolations of the incubation study show that long-term soil incubations with experimental data for multiple carbon pools are conducive to estimate both decomposition and microbial parameters. These efforts should provide essential support to future field-and global-scale simulations, and enable more confident predictions of feedbacks between environmental change and carbon cycling.

In the absence of competition, P. virgatum mass and P uptake were not affected by collembola grazing; grazing did reduce tissue N concentration and root:shoot ratio. Competition from B. nigra plants of the same age/size (simultaneous competition) significantly reduced P. virgatum total, root, and shoot mass relative to control plants not subject to competition. In contrast, when in competition, B. nigra plants did not differ in biomass from B. nigra controls grown without competition. Simultaneous competition also reduced N and P uptake by P. virgatum, but not by B. nigra. Grazing by collembola during simultaneous competition increased the differences in nutrient uptake and tended to shift the competitive balance further toward the non-mycorrhizal B. nigra. When P. virgatum plants were subjected to competition from B. nigra plants which germinated three weeks later (offset competition) the situation was reversed: offset B. nigra plants were negatively affected by competition while the larger, older P. virgatum plants were not. Thus, relative germination date is important in determining the relative competitive ability of these two species. Grazing by collembola did not affect offset competition. The grazing of VAM hyphae by collembola appears to increase N availability in this experimental system. Under simultaneous competition, this N is taken up by the more extensive root system of B. nigra; under offset conditions, the root system of the smaller B. nigra plants is insufficient to take advantage of the added resources. Thus, we suggest that grazing-induced transient changes in nutrient availability and the differential abilities of the two species to make use of these added resources constitute the mechanisms by which relative germination date and collembola grazing influence competition.

Infection process of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp phaseoli on resistant, intermediate and susceptible bean cultivars	TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Phaseolus vulgaris; Fusarium wilt; host defense		The objective of this study was to understand the infection process of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli (Fop) in bean cultivars classified as resistant (Manteigao Fosco 11), intermediate (VP8) and susceptible (Meia Noite). Plants of the three cultivars were inoculated at 10 days after emergence with a suspension of 1x10(6) conidia of Fop per mL. At 43 days after the inoculation, stem segments were observed with a scanner electronic microscope. The cultivars Manteigao Fosco 11 and VP8 presented an occluding material in the xylem vessels, which may have restricted tissue colonization by Fop. The resistance of bean cultivars to Fop seemed also to be explained by structural differences in the xylem tissue.

W43N to improve the antioxidant activity, the production of health-promoting phytochemicals and plant growth regulators in two different cultivars of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) under commercial growth conditions: Tigullio, with green leaves and Dark Opal with purple leaves. Mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants with similar phenology and phosphorus (P) nutritional status were used in order to rule out P nutrition-dependent effects. Antioxidant activity and carotenoids content of Dark Opal leaf extracts were consistently higher than those of Tigullio. Dark Opal was more responsive than Tigullio to the dual inoculation treatment, showing higher antioxidant activity, anthocyanin and rosmarinic acid leaf levels. Present results suggest that dual inoculation with R. intraradices and PGP bacteria may represent an efficient strategy to improve the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites with health-promoting activities in basil plants.

It addresses a large variety of agricultural species (rice, wheat, maize, tomato, potato, oilseed rape, poplar, apple and rose) together with some models (Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, Physcomitrella). Using targeted mutagenesis as its work horse, the project is limited to proof of concept under confined conditions. It mainly covers traits linked to crop culture, such as disease resistance to viruses and fungi, flowering time, plant architecture, tolerance to salinity and plant reproduction but also addresses traits improving the quality of agricultural products for industrial purposes. Examples include virus resistant tomato, early flowering apple and low-amylose starch potato. The wide range of traits illustrates the potential of genome editing towards a more sustainable agriculture through the reduction of pesticides and to the emergence of innovative bio-economy sectors based on custom tailored quality traits.

In this study, improvements were made and a highly efficient mechanical transmission protocol was developed. Several factors that affect the transmission efficiency were identified. Use of two antioxidants (sodium sulfite and mercaptoethanol) and two abrasives (Celite and Carborundum) and application of the inoculum by rubbing with a cotton swab dipped in the inoculum as well as pricking with an inoculation needle resulted in a significantly higher transmission rate. The most susceptible growth stage of peanut to TSWV inoculation was 2 to 3 days after germination (6 to 7 days after planting). The inoculation protocol consistently resulted in a higher percentage of infected plants from different sources of inoculum such as infected peanut, tobacco, and tomato.

However, minimum days to first flowering and marketable maturity took with the application of phosphorus @ 120 kg/ha with un-inoculated control. The number of pods per plant, length of the pod (cm), number of seeds per pod and yield of mature green pods (q/ha) was significantly increased by the application of 120 kg P(2)O(5)/ha and Rhizobium inoculation.

Although the evolution of traits in macro-organisms is well studied, relatively little is known about character evolution in micro-organisms. Here, we surveyed an ancient and ecologically important group of microbial plant symbionts, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and tested hypotheses about the evolution of functional and life-history traits. Variation in the extent of root and soil colonization by AM fungi is constrained to a few nodes basal to the most diverse groups within the phylum, with relatively little variation associated with recent divergences. We found no evidence for a trade-off in biomass allocated to root versus soil colonization in three published glasshouse experiments; rather these traits were positively correlated. Partial support was observed for correlated evolution between fungal colonization strategies and functional benefits of the symbiosis to host plants. The evolution of increased soil colonization was positively correlated with total plant biomass and shoot phosphorus content. Although the effect of AM fungi on infection by root pathogens was phylogenetically conserved, there was no evidence for correlated evolution between the extent of AM fungal root colonization and pathogen infection. Variability in colonization strategies evolved early in the diversification of AM fungi, and we propose that these strategies were influenced by functional interactions with host plants, resulting in an evolutionary stasis resembling trait conservatism.

Torulaspora globosa: rhizosphere yeast promoting lettuce growth on seedlings and under field conditions	HORTICULTURA BRASILEIRA			English	Article						Lactuca sativa; plant growth promotion; biostimulant; cv. Crocantela	PLANT-GROWTH; BACTERIA	Among soil microorganisms, one group stands out as beneficial to agricultural activities: a plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPM). These microorganisms support plants through phytohormone production, nutrient provision and plant health maintenance. Among these PGPM, yeasts have a high potential, which is still not very well known.This study aimed to evaluate the effect of inoculation with the rhizosphere yeast Torulaspora globosa (strain 5S55) on development of lettuce (cv. Crocantela). The first research consisted of inoculating seeds with yeast (100 cells/seed), and inoculating seeds, 7 and/or 15 days after emergence (DAE) (1x10(6) cells/plant). The second one consisted of transplanting seedlings from the first experiment to field. Inoculation of seeds and seedlings provided a significant increase of seedling root dry mass; we observed the significant increase of 27% in productivity of lettuce under field conditions, of shoot fresh mass and a raise of number of leaves per plant. However, studies on inoculation methods, inoculum formulation, cell concentration are essential to optimize the results in growth promotion and to establish technology.

BL3 forms symbiotic interactions with mung bean (Vigna radiata) and contains lrpL-acdS genes, which encode the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase enzyme that cleaves ACC, a precursor of plant ethylene synthesis. Since ethylene interferes with nodule formation in some legumes and plays a role in senescence in plant cells, BL3-enhancing ACC deaminase activity (BL3(+)) and defective mutant (BL3(-)) strains were constructed in order to investigate the effects of this enzyme on symbiosis and nodule senescence. Nodulation competitiveness was weaker in BL3-than in the wild-type, but was stronger in BL3(+). The inoculation of BL3(-) into mung bean resulted in less plant growth, a lower nodule dry weight, and smaller nodule number than those in the wild-type, whereas the inoculation of BL3(+) had no marked effects. However, similar nitrogenase activity was observed with all treatments; it was strongly detected 3 weeks after the inoculation and gradually declined with time, indicating senescence. The rate of plant nodulation by BL3(+) increased in a time-dependent manner. Nodules occupied by BL3(-) formed smaller symbiosomes, and bacteroid degradation was more prominent than that in the wild-type 7 weeks after the inoculation. Changes in biochemical molecules during nodulation were tracked by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy, and the results obtained confirmed that aging processes differed in nodules occupied by BL3 and BL3(-). This is the first study to show the possible role of ACC deaminase activity in senescence in determinate nodules. Our results suggest that an increase in ACC deaminase activity in this strain does not extend the lifespan of nodules, whereas the lack of this activity may accelerate nodule senescence.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi pre-inoculant identity determines community composition in roots	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Arbuscular; Mycorrhizal fungi; Inoculation; T-RFLP; Community ecology	LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM ANALYSIS; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; TROPICAL FOREST; AM FUNGI; COLONIZATION; PCR; GRASSLAND; FIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; PHYLOGENY	Pre-inoculation of seedlings with commercial, typically non-indigenous, AMF inoculants is common practice in horticultural and land reclamation industries. How these practices influence AMF community composition in pre-inoculated seedlings after they are planted in soil containing a resident AMF community is almost completely unknown. However, there may be important implications regarding success of horticultural practices, as well as unexpected ecological consequences. In this study we exposed Leucanthemum vulgare seedlings to five different AMF treatments (pre-inoculation with a representative of Glomus group A and Glomus group B, one of two Gigaspora spp., or no AMF) prior to exposure to a whole-soil, mixed-AMF community inoculum. After a growth period of 75 additional for 28 days, AMF community composition within the roots was analyzed using an approach combining LSU rDNA sequencing and T-RFLP analysis. Our results indicate that the AMF communities that assemble within roots were strongly influenced by AMF pre-inoculant identity. Pre-inoculation with either Glomus spp., unlike what was found for Gigaspora, greatly restricted numbers of other AMF ribotypes able to subsequently colonize roots after exposure to our Glomeraceae-dominated field soil; this suggested that phylogenetic relatedness and life history strategies may play a role in AMF community assembly. Our results further revealed concurrent changes in AMF community functions, as indicated by differences in plant biomass and foliar nutrients. These results serve to highlight the importance of considering life history differences when designing AMF inoculants and may have important implications regarding the introduction of non-indigenous AMF.

Treatments were Rhizobium, chemical fertilizer, Rhizobium + chemical fertilizer and an untreated control. Length and stem diameter, root length, number of leaves, number of nodules, biomass, absolute growth rate was evaluated. Evaluations were performed 30 and 60 days after germination. As a result, it was found that the application of chemical fertilizer Rhizobium and P. vulgaris CUL-156, no significant differences sheds length and stem diameter, leaf number and biomass, at 30 days after germination, while number of nodes increases on treatment with Rhizobium regarding their combination with chemical fertilizer, appreciating that treatment with chemical fertilizer affects Rhizobium nodulation. At 60 days after germination, significant differences between treatments for fresh and total dry mass was found, but not for the foliar and root dry mass and absolute growth rate, although it showed higher values in treated plants chemical fertilizer and its combination with Rhizobium.

Ecology of Floristic Quality Assessment: testing for correlations between coefficients of conservatism, species traits and mycorrhizal responsiveness	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; coefficients of conservatism; disturbance; Floristic Quality Assessment; functional traits; inoculation; succession; tallgrass prairie	FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; ECONOMICS SPECTRUM; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE; DEMOGRAPHIC RATES; GROWTH-RATE; SEED SIZE; PLANT; WORLDWIDE; SOIL; PRODUCTIVITY	Many plant species are limited to habitats relatively unaffected by anthropogenic disturbance, so protecting these undisturbed habitats is essential for plant conservation. Coefficients of conservatism (C values) were developed as indicators of a species' sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance, and these values are used in Floristic Quality Assessment as a means of assessing natural areas and ecological restoration. However, assigning of these values is subjective and improved quantitative validation of C values is needed. We tested whether there are consistent differences in life histories between species with high and low C values. To do this, we grew 54 species of tallgrass prairie plants in a greenhouse and measured traits that are associated with trade-offs on the fast-slow continuum of life-history strategies. We also grew plants with and without mycorrhizal fungi as a test of these species' reliance on this mutualism. We compared these traits and mycorrhizal responsiveness to C values. We found that six of the nine traits we measured were correlated with C values, and together, traits predicted up to 50 % of the variation in C values. Traits including fast growth rates and greater investment in reproduction were associated with lower C values, and slow growth rates, long-lived leaves and high root: shoot ratios were associated with higher C values. Additionally, plants with high C values and a slow life history were more responsive to mutualisms with mycorrhizal fungi. Overall, our results connect C values with life-history trade-offs, indicating that high C value species tend to share a suite of traits associated with a slow life history.

Genotype effect and soil effect were studied independently. Also, the interactions between both factors (genotypes and soils) were considered. The activity was determined by thymidine and leucine incorporation analysis, and Biolog ECO plates were used to study bacterial functional diversity. Additionally, fungi groups (genera and/or species) were studied in the different rhizospheres. Statistical differences on thymidine incorporation between plant genotypes were only found in two of the soils. In addition, functional diversity (measured by Shanonn-Weaver index), showed statistical differences only in soil 1 for line N8035 (line B) vs. the other lines. Redundancy analysis (RDA) performed with Biolog data indicates and important effect of soil type, but also an effect of genotype since line N8035 (line B) was separated from the other lines within each soil in the RDA ordination, in spite of genotypic differences between them were minimum. Furthermore, carboxylic acids and amino acids were found to be the Biolog plate substrates with more influence is samples ordination in the Redundancy Analysis (RDA). However, fungi seem to be less labile to plant selection than bacterial probably due to a lower turn-over time of fungi than bacteria coupled with the short phenology of Arabidopsis. In this paper, plant-soil-microorganism relationships in the rhizosphere were studied, and the complex interactions between them were highlighed. More studies are necessary to go deep in these interactions and to be able to asses the impact of genetically modified plants.	[Garcia-Villaraco Velasco, A.; Probanza, A.; Gutierrez Manero, F.

Lactococcus and Lactobacillus genera, either independently or as a mixture. The gross composition, the microbial viability, and the organic compound profile in those model cheeses were monitored, throughout a 60 day-ripening period. Microbial viability, pH, and levels of acetic and lactic acids were the physicochemical and biological parameters that experienced the most significant changes in such matrices - which were, in turn, dependent on the type of inoculum used. No synergisms emerged upon combination of the two strains, in terms of sugar uptake and organic acid release. The contribution of each adventitious bacterium - either independently or in the presence of each other, to the development of expected biochemical characteristics of model cheeses (even though to a lower extent than in actual ones) was confirmed, whereas the type of rennet used proved to be not relevant.

The genotype UFPI-491 was used as a trap plant for rhizobia, with soil samples collected in Piaui State being used as the inoculum source. For isolation, nodules were collected at 45 days after seedling emergence-a period that presented the highest values for number and biomass of nodules evaluated in a previous experiment. In total, 50 isolates were obtained and placed into groups based on divergence from the morphological and physiological characterization. In general, the restriction patterns obtained with endonucleases MboI, HaeIII and NheI showed sufficient variability to discriminate between the isolates in this study. The main characteristics exhibited by isolates identified species from the genera Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Rhizobium.

Loss-of-function mutations in the Arabidopsis EMBRYONIC FLOWER (EMF) genes cause Arabidopsis to eliminate rosette shoot growth and transform the apical meristem from indeterminate to determinate growth by producing a single terminal flower on all nodes. We have identified the EMF1 gene by positional cloning. The deduced polypeptide has no homology with any protein of known function except a putative protein in the rice genome with which EMF1 shares common motifs that include nuclear localization signals, P-loop, and LXXLL elements. Alteration of EMF1 expression in transgenic plants caused progressive changes in flowering time, shoot determinacy, and inflorescence architecture. EMF1 and its related sequence may belong to a new class of proteins that function as transcriptional regulators of phase transition during shoot development.

Pectate lyase was detected in decayed fruit tissue 5 days after fruit inoculation, concomitantly with the decrease of the preformed antifungal 1-acetoxy- 2-hydroxy-4-oxo-12,15-heneicosa diene to subfungitoxic concentrations. A higher amount of the enzyme was detected in the leading edge of the decayed lesion than in the already decayed tissue. As a first stage to determine the relation between PLs from C. gloeosporiodes attacking avocado and PLs from Colletotrichum strains attacking other fruits, a cDNA encoding PL of C. gloeosporioides was cloned and sequenced. The cloned DNA showed high homology to known pels from fungi, bacteria and plants. The pel gene of C. gloeosporioides hybridized to single genomic restriction fragments from C. gloeosporioides isolated from mango and papaya fruits and Colletotrichum musae from banana fruit. Western blot analysis of culture fluids from these pathogens revealed one band of 38-41 kDa that specifically cross-reacted with antibodies raised against the pectate lyase from C. gloeosporioides isolated from avocado. Pectate lyase antibodies had no effect on spore germination, germ tube elongation or appressoria formation. However, when conidia were mixed with the antibodies prior to inoculation, symptom development was inhibited on avocado, mango and banana fruits. These results suggest the presence of a similar PL in Colletotrichum strains attacking avocado, mango, papaya and banana. The detection and inhibition of fungal development by PL antibodies suggest the importance of this enzyme during C. gloeosporioides attack in fruits. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPR) must colonize the plant roots to contribute to the plant's endogenous pool of phytohormones. Colonization of these plant growth promoting rhizobacteria isolated from rhizosplane and soil of different crops was evaluated on different root types to establish if the mechanism of host specificity exist. The bacteria were isolated from maize, wheat, rice, canola and cotton and-phytohormone production was detected and quantified by HPLC. Bacteria were inoculated on surface sterilized seeds of different crops and seeds were germinated. After 7 days the bacteria were re isolated from the roots and the effect of these bacteria was observed by measuring increase in root length. Bacteria isolated from one plant family (monocots) having fibrous root performed well on similar root system and failed to give significant results on other roots (tap root) of dicots. Some aggressive strains were able to colonize both root systems. The plant growth promoting activities of the bacteria were optimum on the same plant from whom roots they were isolated. The results suggest that bacteria adapt to the root they naturally inhabit and colonize the same plant root systems preferably. Although the observe trend indicate host specificity but some bacteria were aggressive colonizers which grew on all the plants used in experiment.

The aerial surface of plants is a habitat for large and diverse microbial communities; termed the phyllosphere. These microbes are unavoidably consumed by herbivores, and while the entomopathogens are well studied, the impact of non-pathogenic bacteria on herbivore life history is less clear. 2. Previous work has suggested that consumption of non-entomopathogenic bacteria induces a costly immune response that might decrease the risk of infection. However, we hypothesised that insect herbivores should be selective in how they respond to commonly encountered non-pathogenic bacteria on their host plants to avoid unnecessary and costly immune responses. 3. An ecologically realistic scenario was used in which we fed cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni Hubner, larvae on cabbage or cucumber leaves treated with the common non-entomopathogenic phyllosphere bacteria, Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. syringae. Their constitutive immunity and resistance to a pathogenic bacterium (Bacillus thuringiensis; Bt) and a baculovirus (T. ni single nucleopolyhedrovirus) were then examined. 4. While feeding on bacteria-treated leaves reduced the growth rate and condition of T. ni, there was no effect on immunity (haemolymph antibacterial and phenoloxidase activities and haemocyte numbers). Phyllosphere bacteria weakly affected the resistance of T. ni to Bt but the direction of this effect was concentration dependent; resistance to the virus was unaffected. Host plant had an impact, with cucumber-fed larvae being more susceptible to Bt. 5. The lack of evidence for a costly immune response to non-entomopathogenic bacteria suggests that T. ni are probably adapted to consuming common phyllosphere bacteria, and highlights the importance of the evolutionary history of participants in multi-trophic interactions.

The impacts of multiple global changes on the structure of microbial communities may be mediated by specific microbial groups with different life-history strategies. Here, we investigated the combined effects of elevated CO2 and N addition on soil microbial communities using PLFA profiling in a short-term grassland mesocosm experiment. We also examined the linkages between the relative abundance of r-and K-strategist microorganisms and resistance of the microbial community structure to experimental treatments. N addition had a significant effect on microbial community structure, likely driven by concurrent increases in plant biomass and in soil labile C and N. In contrast, microbial community structure did not change under elevated CO2 or show significant CO2 x N interactions. Resistance of soil microbial community structure decreased with increasing fungal/bacterial ratio, but showed a positive relationship with the Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacterial ratio. Our findings suggest that the Grampositive/ Gram-negative bacteria ratio may be a useful indicator of microbial community resistance and that K-strategist abundance may play a role in the short-term stability of microbial communities under global change.

Field assessment of symbiotic N-2 fixation in wild and cultivated Cyclopia species in the South African fynbos by N-15 natural abundance	TREE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						natural populations; plantations	BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; PASTURE LEGUMES; WEST AUSTRALIA; TREES; QUANTIFICATION; LEGUMINOSAE; NODULATION; VEGETATION; FOREST; PLANTS	Nitrogen (N) derived from symbiotic fixation of atmospheric N-2 in wild and cultivated populations of Cyclopia, a woody endemic genus used to make honeybush tea in the Western Cape of South Africa, was quantified by the N-15 natural abundance method. Because Cyclopia species are naturally mycorrhizal, non-N-2-fixing arbuscular mycorrhizal shrubs of similar phenology to Cyclopia were chosen as reference plants to provide the delta(15) N value of soil-derived N. Isotopic analysis showed that wild populations of Cyclopia were highly dependent on N-2 fixation for their N nutrition, ranging from 70 +/- 4% to 100 +/- 7% (mean +/- SE) at all sites, except for one. Further evidence of the high dependency of wild Cyclopia populations on symbiotic N was provided by their significantly higher foliar N concentrations compared with the non-legume reference plants. However, cultivated Cyclopia exhibited variable amounts of N-2 fixation, with Cyclopia genistoides (L.) R. Br., for example, showing low amounts of N-2 fixation at Sites P2 and P3 (0 +/- 51% and 8 +/- 46%, respectively) as a result of low D values (D is defined as the difference between the mean delta N-15 value of the reference plants and the B value of the test Cyclopia species, where B is the delta N-15 of an inoculated test legume grown in an N-free growth medium), whereas at Sites P1, P2, P5 and P6, up to 89 +/- 2%, 94 +/- 13%, 85 +/- 13% and 100 +/- 18%, respectively, plant N was derived from atmospheric fixation. The high symbiotic N nutrition observed for wild populations of Cyclopia suggests that these populations are major contributors to the N economy of the nutrient-poor soils of the South African fynbos. These data indicate that by breeding for high N-2 fixation rates in Cyclopia cultivars and selecting more efficient rhizobial strains, this legume has the potential to achieve higher N-2 fixation rates under cultivation. The low variability in Cyclopia delta N-15 values within sites, however, suggests that genetic variability is not a major factor influencing N-2 fixation rates in cultivated Cyclopia, and that more benefit may be gained from soil amelioration and the selection of improved rhizobial strains.

Cheeses were made at two commercial Norwegian dairies using different milk treatments (pasteurisation versus microfiltration plus pasteurisation) and the same type of starter cultures. Microflora in the cheese varied according to different plant site, milk treatment, and ripening time. PAB dominated the microflora throughout the ripening process. Leuconostoc spp., most probably from the starter, dominated among the isolates from the cheese using microfiltered and pasteurised milk; however, after 40 weeks of ripening non-starter lactic acid bacteria specie Lactobacillus casei/paracasei and Leuconostoc spp. dominated at the dairy using pasteurised milk. Cheese made at the two plants on two subsequent days showed almost identical microflora throughout ripening. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Acetylene reduction activity (ARA) of nodules, leghemoglobin content and nodule structure were followed 55, 75 and 85 d after sowing. ARA declined significantly under salt treatments and the lowest ARA was observed at day 85 after sowing. Decrease in ARA was consistent with decreased nodule leghemoglobin content. The leghemoglobin content of control plants decreased by 50% at day 85 indicating senescence of nodules. This senescence was further accelerated by salt treatment after which the leghemoglobin content fell to negligible levels. The structural changes associated with salt stress were mainly reduction in size of the nodules, decreased meristematic zone, reduced number and degradation of symbiosomes, reduced intercellular spaces and deposition of electron dense material in the intercellular spaces in the cortex of nodules.

This phytotoxin was produced in soft rot regions of the infection. In C. annuum, the most aggressive isolate produced the highest botrydial concentrations in planta. The levels of botrydial produced by this isolate did not correlate with the reported relative susceptibilities of four P. vulgaris genotypes. The results suggest that botrydial is a pathogenicity factor for this fungus, but not a primary determinant of pathogenicity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

These transformations are more extreme in some legume species than others, leading to fundamental differences in rhizobial life history and evolution. Here, we analysed the distribution of different bacteroid morphologies over a legume phylogeny to understand the evolutionary history of this host-influenced differentiation. Using existing electron micrographs and new flow cytometric analyses, bacteroid morphologies were categorized as swollen or nonswollen for 40 legume species in the subfamily Papilionoideae. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks were used to reconstruct ancestral states at the bases of all major subclades within the papilionoids. Extreme bacteroid differentiation leading to swelling was found in five out of the six major papilionoid subclades. The inferred ancestral state for the Papilionoideae was hosting nonswollen bacteroids, indicating at least five independent origins of host traits leading to swollen bacteroids. Repeated evolution of host traits causing bacteroid swelling indicates a possible fitness benefit to the plant. Furthermore, as bacteroid swelling is often correlated with loss of reproductive viability, the evolution of bacteroid cooperation or cheating strategies could be fundamentally different between the two bacteroid morphologies.

ChEC was characterized with respect to its water vapor permeability (WVP) and mechanical properties. Results indicated that C. fragariae grew from the third day in strawberries stored at 20 degrees C, whilst at 5 degrees C disease symptoms were observed after 10 days in fruit inoculated and treated with ChEC after 24 h. The weight loss was reduced 15 times and firmness was higher by 33% in fruit treated with ChEC and stored at 5 degrees C. The antioxidant capacity of strawberries increased at the end of the storage only in control group. In conclusion, ChEC can be an effective technology for preserving quality strawberries for 17 days at 5 degrees C.

Wound inoculation of detached green strawberry cv. Elsanta fruit with Aureobasidium pullulans prevented grey mould rot on fruit inoculated 2 days later with Botrytis cinerea. Treatment of white, pink and red-ripe fruit did not, however, control grey mould. Treatment of wound sites on green fruit with both live and heat-killed A. pullulans cells reduced B. cinerea infection compared to controls. Dip-inoculation of unwounded green strawberry fruit with A. pullulans when still attached to the plant delayed the development of grey mould after harvest at the fully ripe stage. The (i) efficacy of A. pullulans on green but not on ripening fruit, (ii) partial inhibitory effect of both live and heat-killed A. pullulans cells and (iii) absence of evidence for antibiotic production from in vitro competition tests suggest that control of grey mould on green fruit is at least partly due to a mechanism other than antagonism and / or competition. Bioassays showed that skin tissue from green fruit treated with A. pullulans had greater antifungal activity than control tissue. Thus, enhanced natural disease resistance in green strawberry fruit contributed to grey mould rot suppression by A. pullulans.

Tomato plants grown in soil supplemented with CNTs produce two times more flowers and fruit compared to plants grown in control soil. The effect of carbon nanotubes on microbial community of CNT-treated soil is determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and pyrosequencing analysis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes are the most dominant groups in the microbial community of soil. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are found to increase, whereas Proteobacteria and Verrucomicorbia decrease with increasing concentration of CNTs. The results of comparing diversity indices and species level phylotypes (OTUs) between samples showed that there is not a significant affect on bacterial diversity.

F-1 descendants of the cross Delight x Ruby Seedless (DRs) were used as the female parent and crossed with various seedless cultivars. The berries of DRs have excellent table traits but they retain small seed traces at maturity. Blush Seedless and DRs were used as female parents, and 354 ovules from five crosses were tested. The percentage of embryos that developed using DRs as the female parent was higher (26.7-35.8%) than when a seedless cultivar was the female parent (5.9-6.7%). The best ovule excision time [days after flowering (DAF)] for ovule inoculation was tested in another set of crosses and found to be DAF 48, 50, and 50 for DR1 x Monukka, DR6 x Thompson Seedless, and DR7 x Zhengguo Seedless, respectively. A total of 569 hybrid progeny were obtained from 13 hybrid combinations; 311 of these survived and were established in soil after hardening. We used three molecular markers (SCC8, SCF27, and GSLP1) to analyze 15 parents used in the hybrid combinations. SCC8 had a 1018-bp band in the seedless parents and in some of the DR parents, while SCF27 had a 2000-bp band in all seedless and DR parents. GSLP1 had a 569-bp band in all of the seedless parents tested, whereas the seeded and DR parents had no bands of this size. Therefore, GSLP1 was used to screen the progeny for possible seedlessness. Eight strains had the 569-bp band; these were preliminarily identified as being seedless since they are in juvenile phase, but they have not yet been evaluated for fruiting characteristics. If the strains identified by using GSLP1 are confirmed to be seedless, this marker will be a valuable tool in breeding for seedlessness in grape.

Accumulation of specific flavonoids in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) as a function of the early tripartite symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Bradyrhizobium japonicum (Kirchner) Jordan	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						tripartite symbiosis; signalling; flavonoids; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; rhizobia; soybean; early interaction; legume	MEDICAGO-SATIVA; N-2 FIXATION; NITROGEN; ROOTS; SOIL; PHOSPHORUS; YIELD; CROP; COLONIZATION; NODULATION	This study is the first report assessing the effect of soil inoculation on the signalling interaction of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and soybean plants throughout the early stages of colonisation that lead to the tripartite symbiosis. In a study using soil disturbance to produce contrasting indigenous AMF treatments, the flavonoids daidzein, genistein and coumestrol were identified as possible signals for regulating the establishment of the tripartite symbiosis. However, it was unclear whether soil disturbance induced changes in flavonoid root accumulation other than through changing the potential for AMF colonization. In this study, soil treatments comprising all possible combinations of AMF and B. japonicum were established to test whether (1) modifications in root flavonoid accumulation depend on the potential for AMF colonization, and (2) synthesis and accumulation of flavonoids in the roots change over time as a function of the early plant-microbial interactions that lead to the tripartite symbiosis. The study was comprised of two phases. First, maize was grown over 3-week periods to promote the development of the AM fungus Glomus clarum. Second, the interaction between soybean, G. clarum and B. japonicum was evaluated at 6, 10, 14 and 40 days after plant emergence. Root colonization by G. clarum had a positive effect on nodulation 14 days after emergence, producing, 30% more nodules which were 40% heavier than those on roots solely inoculated with B. japonicum. The tripartite symbiosis resulted in 23% more N-2 being fixed than did the simpler symbiosis between soybean and B. japonicum. The presence of both symbionts changed accumulation of flavonoids in roots. Daidzein and coumestrol increased with plant growth. However, development of the tripartite symbiosis caused a decrease in coumestrol; accumulation of daidzein, the most abundant flavonoid, was reduced in the presence of AMF. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

While quite a few studies tested the effects of mycorrhiza on life history traits, such as growth, development and reproduction, of aboveground herbivores, information on possible effects of mycorrhiza on host plant choice of herbivores via constitutive and/or induced plant volatiles is lacking. Here we assessed whether symbiosis of the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae with common bean plants Phaseolus vulgaris influences the response of the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae to volatiles of plants that were clean or infested with spider mites. Mycorrhiza-naive and -experienced spider mites, reared on mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal bean plants for several days before the experiments, were subjected to Y-tube olfactometer choice tests. Experienced but not naive spider mites distinguished between constitutive volatiles of clean non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants, preferring the latter. Neither naive nor experienced spider mites distinguished between spider mite-induced volatiles of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. Learning the odor of clean mycorrhizal plants, resulting in a subsequent preference for these odors, is adaptive because mycorrhizal plants are more favorable host plants for fitness of the spider mites than are non-mycorrhizal plants.

Generally, no differences were found in total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, streptococci and lactoccocci counts among cheeses but these microorganism counts increased during 60 and 90 d storage especially in Cl (uncoated sample) as compared with coated samples. Antimicrobial effectiveness of the films against moulds was measured on 30, 60, and 90 d of storage. In addition of fish EO into chitosan edible films samples were showed to affect significantly decreased the moulds (p<0.05) as 1.15 Log CFU/g in C4 (with fish oil (1% w/v) fortified chitosan film) on the 90th d, while in Cl as 3.89 Log CFU/g on the 90th d of ripening. Compared to other cheese samples, C2 (coated with chitosan film) and C4 coated cheese samples revealed higher levels of water-soluble nitrogen and ripening index at the end of storage. C2 coated cheese samples were preferred more by the panellists while C4 coated cheese samples received the lowest scores.

The production losses vary from 50 to 80%. Mango growth is intermittent being characterized by resting periods (RP) intercalary between each vegetative flow. Each new flush promotes changes in the intensity of epidemics, but the interaction of the RPs on the pathogen virulence and pathogenesis are unknown. To provide some information about this interaction, the effect of Fusarium spp. infection on incubation periods (PI), maximum severity (Ymax) and days to maximum severity (DYmax) was compared in nursery plants of cvs 'Mallika' and 'Haden' inoculated in the resting and active early growth (juvenile) stages, using the veneer grafting technique to end the rest phase in 2016. When both cultivars were inoculated in the resting stage, at 14 and 0 incubation days before grafting (dbg), 'Haden' was more susceptible than 'Mallika' showing quicker PIs and greater DYmax and Ymax in 42, 55 and 82% respectively. Likewise, 'Haden' shoots inoculated during resting stages or active early growth, at 22 days after grafting (dag), had a shortest PI and DYmax values, by up to 32 and 45% respect to mature inoculated shoots that remained attached to the plant. Ymax was not affected by the phenology of the inoculated shoots and PI were higher only in shoots inoculated at 75-85 dag (P < 0.05%). Middle and apical cross sections of mature and juvenile 'Haden' and 'Mallika' shoots observed under scanning electron microscope showed contrasted anatomical differences in tissue differentiation.

Phenotypic variability in plant root biomass could impact C cycling through belowground plant allocation, rooting architecture, and microbial community abundance and composition. We used a pulse-chase C-13 labeling experiment with compound-specific stable-isotope probing to investigate the importance of rhizodeposit C to deep soil microbial biomass under two switchgrass ecotypes (Panicum virgatum L, Kanlow and Summer) with contrasting root morphology. We quantified root phenology, soil microbial biomass (phospholipid fatty acids, PLFA), and microbial rhizodeposit uptake (C-13-PLFAs) to 150 cm over one year during a severe drought. The lowland ecotype, Kanlow, had two times more root biomass with a coarser root system compared to the upland ecotype, Summer. Over the drought, Kanlow lost 78% of its root biomass, while Summer lost only 60%. Rhizosphere microbial communities associated with both ecotypes were similar. However, rhizodeposit uptake under Kanlow had a higher relative abundance of gram-negative bacteria (44.1%), and Summer rhizodeposit uptake was primarily in saprotrophic fungi (48.5%). Both microbial community composition and rhizodeposit uptake shifted over the drought into gram-positive communities. Rhizosphere soil C was greater one year later under Kanlow due to turnover of unlabeled structural root C. Despite a much greater root biomass under Kanlow, rhizosphere delta C-13 was not significantly different between the two ecotypes, suggesting greater microbial C input under the finer rooted species, Summer, whose microbial associations were predominately saprotrophic fungi. Ecotype specific microbial communities can direct rhizodeposit C flow and C accrual deep in the soil profile and illustrate the importance of the microbial community in plant strategies to survive environmental stress such as drought.

A. 2012. Effect of the timing of fungicide application on Fusarium head blight and mycotoxin contamination in wheat. Plant Dis. 96:845-851. Fungicide application to control Fusarium head blight (FHB) and accompanying mycotoxin contamination in wheat is generally performed at anthesis because wheat is most susceptible to FHB around this stage. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the timing of fungicide application on FHB and mycotoxin (deoxynivalenol and nivalenol) accumulation in wheat based on our previous finding that the late period of grain development (beyond 20 days after anthesis [DAA]) is important to determine the final toxin contamination level in wheat. Thiophanate-methyl fungicide was tested under artificial inoculation conditions in which moisture and inoculum spores were provided throughout the testing period. Eight treatments differing in application timing (anthesis, 10, 20, and 30 DAA) and in the number of applications (0 to 2) were tested for 2 years. The results indicated that fungicide application timing differentially affects FHB (disease) and mycotoxin concentration. Fungicide application at 20 DAA reduced mycotoxin concentration in matured grain without reducing FHB severity, whereas application at anthesis was crucial for reducing FHB. These results and our previous findings suggest that around 20 DAA (late milk stage) is a potentially critical timing for mycotoxin control in wheat.

Walp) which received different inoculation treatments. The experiment was conducted under a randomized block design, split-split-plot arrangement with four replicates. Treatments were green manures for the main plot, nitrogen sources for the split-plot and bi-weekly plant samplings for the split-split-plot. The green manures under study were pearl millet - Pennisetum americanum; velvet beans - Stizolobium aterrimum; or spontaneous vegetation, while nitrogen sources were Native rhizobial population; nitrogen fertilizer 50 kg ha(-1) of N as urea; inoculation with RELARE recommended rhizobial strains - BR 3301 + BR 3302; or UFRPE recommended rhizobial strains - NFB 6156 + NFB 700. Cowpea cultivar Patativa was used, which is recommended by regional extension services. From seven days after germination up to final physiological maturity bi-weekly two-plant samples were collected for nodule number and dry mass determination and aerial part dry mass determination. From 60 days after germination weekly harvests of each split-plot were conducted for grain yield determination. Velvet bean increased uninoculated cowpea nodulation. Cowpea inoculation with recommended strains or native population increase allowed biomass and grain production similar to fertilization with 50 kg ha(-1) of N.

Microbial groups were monitored during ripening for 60 days. A total of 1442 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates randomly chosen were identified by molecular methods. Counts of mesophilic LAB exceeded 9 log cfu g(-1) on day 1 and decreased 0.5 log units during ripening whereas counts of lactobacilli and leuconostocs increased and those of enterococci remained constant. Thirty-three LAB species belonging to eight different genera were isolated, with higher biodiversity on day 1 (26 species) than on day 60 (20 species). Structural genes coding for nisin, lacticin 481, lactococcin B, six plantaricins and five enterocins were detected in LAB isolates. The information obtained on the technological properties of selected isolates may be useful in developing specific starters for goat milk cheeses, capable of maintaining their distinctive sensory characteristics.

J	157	MW	Vieira, RF				Vieira, RF			Sewage sludge effects on soybean growth and nitrogen fixation	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS			English	Article						phosphorus fertilization; nitrogenase activity; nodule number; nodule weight	SOIL; SURVIVAL	The effect of sewage sludge application, as a source of phosphorus, on dinitrogen symbiotic fixation in soybean was evaluated. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse and included eight different treatments: (1) no fertilization, (2) complete fertilization, (3) inoculation with rhizobia plus phosphate fertilization (IS+P), (4) inoculation with rhizobia without phosphate fertilization (IS-P), (5) inoculation plus dose 1 of sewage sludge (IS+SS1), (6) inoculation plus dose 2 of sewage sludge (IS+SS2), (7) without inoculation plus dose 1 of sewage sludge, and (8) without inoculation plus dose 2 of sewage sludge. The two rates of sewage amendment corresponded to 11.2 t ha(-1) and 22.4 t ha-1 and were calculated on the basis of the sewage phosphorus content and the amount of phosphorus recommended for soybean fertilization. Results were evaluated 49 and 63 days after plant emergence. Nodule number and weight decreased as follows: IS+P > IS+SSI, IS+SS2 > IS-P No nodules were formed without inoculation. The acetylene reduction activity was highest for the IS+P treatment 49 days after plant emergence. At the 63-day harvest that parameter was similar among IS+P, IS+SS1 and IS+SS2 treatments. The total amounts of nitrogen in shoots were similar for IS+P, IS+SS1 and IS+SS2 treatments at the first harvest but by 63 days after plant emergence, total amounts of nitrogen in above-ground parts (shoot and pods) were higher in IS+P and IS+SS2. This was due to higher pod dry weights. This study demonstrated that soybean growth can be improved by sewage sludge at a low application rate without the necessity of additional phosphorus fertilization.

Here, we describe a procedure for bacterial inoculation of soybean plants, followed by the assessment of systemic infection and impact on plant fitness. Soybean (Glycine max) seedlings were mechanically wounded using a device that mimics insect herbivory and inoculated with known cell numbers of Burkholderia gladioli bacteria previously isolated from an insect host. The impact on the plants was evaluated by monitoring changes in height, time to flowering and chlorophyll content during plant development, and by quantifying seed production in comparison to plants inoculated with sterile water. The presence and proliferation of bacterial infection were examined in tissues from developed plants using quantitative PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

It contributes significantly to the sustainability of traditional cropping systems because of the predominance of small-scale farmers who cultivate beans in those areas. The objectives of this work were to evaluate bush bean varieties under common agronomic cropping systems and to evaluate breeding lines under low N-fertility sole cropping and intercropping systems. The purpose of the study was to characterize the genotype and cropping system's variability in symbiotic and plant characters and to identify the most suitable genotypes to establish an effective symbiosis with indigenous strains of Rhizobium. No significant differences among the bush bean varieties evaluated under typical fertilization practices were observed for N-2-fixation and plant traits except for seed nitrogen. Significant differences among the bean lines studied under low N-fertilization conditions were detected for plant growth, plant component and N-2-fixation traits. A significant interaction of bean genotype x cropping system was found for number of nodules per plant and nodule moisture on the bush bean varieties studied, and for days to emergence, days to flowering, end of flowering, shoot length, root dry weight and shoot nitrogen on the bean lines evaluated. Nodulation parameters were correlated positively with the yield components, shoot and root parts and duration of flowering, and correlated negatively with seed crude protein, pod and seed dimensions and seed dry weight. These observations indicate that it may be possible to increase both the symbiotic N-2-fixation and seed yield through plant breeding.

The percentage of infected spikelets was a better indication of the amount of fungal biomass present than the percentage of infected heads. This suggests that Fusarium head blight resistance in this population is mainly based on resistance to colonization and that resistance to establishment of the initial infection plays only a minor role. Plants from a susceptible and a resistant breeding line were inoculated with F. culmorum at flowering time. Four weeks after inoculation heads were selected with Fusarium-infected spikelets levels ranging from 0 to 100%. At this time only low levels of ergosterol were detected in the kernels. Eight weeks after inoculation, ergosterol concentrations in chaff and kernels were significantly higher in the susceptible line compared with the resistant breeding line. At 4 and 8 weeks after inoculation the trichothecene deoxynivalenol content of chaff and kernels was also much higher in the susceptible line than in the resistant line. The Fusarium head blight resistant line possesses resistance to hyphal invasion. It appears that deoxynivalenol is transported from the chaff to the young kernel and the pathogen then colonizes the kernel. In the resistant line deoxynivalenol translocation from chaff to kernel was inhibited and little fungal colonization occurred. It is hypothesized that this is based on a membrane-based trichothecene tolerance.

Samples of raw milk, curd and cheese were collected from three representative farmers of the production area and used to isolate autochthonous LAB. Phenotypic and genotypic (species-specific PCR assay) identification of isolated LAB was done. Twenty-eight strains of LAB isolated from milk, curd and cheese were screened for acidifying and proteolytic activities. LAB strains with the better attributes were used as mesophilic starter cultures in technological trials: experimental cheeses manufactured with the addition of autochthonous LAB and control cheeses were compared for LAB and pH evolution. Experimental cheeses presented a significant increase in the mesophilic lactic acid microflora up to 14 days of ripening and significantly lower pH values up to seven days of ripening. The use of wild selected mesophilic lactic acid bacteria, together with thermisation of milk, for the Caciotta della Garfagnana looks very promising and could help to both standardise the production and improve quality and traditional characteristics of this type of cheese.

To investigate the specificity of the isolate C. gloeosporioides to green fruits, fungal behaviours and anthracnose development on green and red pepper fruits were compared using light and stereo microscopic techniques. When the isolate of C. gloeosporioides was inoculated on both green and red fruits, conidial germination, appressoria, and infection hyphae were observed on both fruits within 24 h after inoculation. The fungal invasion and colonization continued to the epidermal cells of green fruits, but not to those of red ones. Initial anthracnose symptoms were detected only on green fruits at 2 days after inoculation resulting in typical sunken necrosis within 5 days after inoculation. Thus the specificity of the isolate to green fruits may be due to successful invasion and colonization of the infection hyphae from appressoria into the epidermal cells through epicuticular layers of green pepper fruits, but not on red ones.

Here, we briefly review the current knowledge of how the foliar endophytic fungi and nutrient cycling interact. Recent findings suggest that endophytes may affect plant litter quality, organisms that control litter decomposition and the availability of nutrients in plant communities. However, the results obtained so far are highly variable. We attempt to integrate these observations with the knowledge of ecology and life-history strategies of endophytic fungi, and highlight general rules and gaps in our knowledge. Finally, we suggest testable hypotheses for future studies.

Foliar application of pyraclostrobin fungicide enhances the growth, rhizobial-nodule formation and nitrogenase activity in soybean (var. JS-335)	PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Growth; Leghemoglobin; Nitrogenase; Pyraclostrobin; Soybean; Yield	STROBILURIN; LEGHEMOGLOBIN; RESISTANCE	A field study was conducted to investigate the impact of the fungicide pyraclostrobin (F500 - Headline (R); a.i. 20%) on the activity of nitrogenase in soybean (var. JS-335). Pyraclostrobin (F500) was applied on the leaves of soybean plants at 10 and 20 days after emergence (DAE) of seedlings at concentrations ranging from 0.05% to 1%. Leghemoglobin (Lb) content and nitrogenase activity in root nodules were analyzed at 45th day after emergence of seedlings indicated a remarkable increase in Lb content and enhanced activity of nitrogenase in the root nodules of pyraclostrobin treated plants. The fungicide also enhanced the number of nodules along with weight of nodules, root biomass and growth of shoot and leaves. Enhanced nitrogen fixation in the root nodules by pyraclostrobin improves the growth of the plant in soybean before flowering and pod formation which ultimately resulted in yield and yield attributes. These results suggest that pyraclostrobin (F500) can be successfully employed as a foliar spray under field conditions to enhance the growth, nitrogen assimilation and hence yield of soybean.

This is the first report on the effect of light intensity and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on the growth of a tropical forage grass, being a relevant study to improve pasture management in conventional farming and integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the effects of light intensity and Burkholderia pyrrocinia and Pseudomonas fluorescens inoculation on Brachiaria brizantha cv. BRS PiatA growth, and phenotypic plasticity to shade. The experiment was conducted in a semi-controlled environment. Seedlings of B.brizantha were allocated to full sun and shade. P. fluorescens and B.pyrrocinia were inoculated individually or co-inoculated by soil drench, 14 days after seedling emergence. We evaluated morphogenesis, structural and growth parameters. Irrespective of the light regime, co-inoculated plants had greater leaf area and SPAD index (chlorophyll content). Increase in total biomass production in co-inoculated plants was over 100% and 300%, under full sun and shade respectively. Co-inoculated P. fluorescens and B.pyrrocinia increased shade tolerance in B.brizantha, improving plant performance. Co-inoculation promoted growth in B.brizantha under both sun and shade, indicating its potential as a bio-fertilizer in conventional and integrated systems, especially in silvopastoral systems, where light availability to pasture growth may be limited.

However, information regal-ding naturally, occurring seed-associated endophytes and vertical transmission among different life-history stages of hosts is limited. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from seeds and seedlings of 10 Eucalyptus species and two hybrids. The results showed that endophytic bacteria, Such as Bacillus, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus and Methylobacterium, are vertically transferred from seeds to seedlings. In addition, the endophytic bacterium Pantoea agglomerans was tagged with the gfp gene, inoculated into seeds and further reisolated from seedlings. These results suggested it novel approach to change the profile of the plants, where the bacterium is a delivery vehicle for desired traits. This is the first report of an endophytic bacterial community residing in Eucalyptus seeds and the transmission of these bacteria from seeds to seedlings. The bacterial species reported ill this work have been described as providing benefits to host plants. Therefore, we Suggest that endophytic bacteria can be transmitted vertically from seeds to seedlings, assuring the support of the bacterial community in the host plant.

We investigated how the crop harvest time, which depends on the hemp valorization strategy envisaged by the farmer, affected the initial stem quality and the subsequent microbial degradation dynamics of retting. We used simulated rains and dews to carry out retting under laboratory conditions for 42 days at 15 degrees C with hemp stems harvested at different times (flowering and seed maturity stage). The microbial colonization and changes in the bast tissue architecture were tracked from day 0 to day 42 using colorimetry, surface infrared spectroscopy, chemical analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. The early changes in the microbial colonization and color of the stem surface and the degradation of the bast tissue parenchyma followed the same pattern during retting for the two stem qualities. However, the kinetic of these processes was 7-14 days faster for the flowering stems, which had higher initial soluble and lower lignin contents than the mature stems. The results suggest a promising potential use of colorimetry and surface infrared spectroscopy data as candidate indicators for the dew retting progress in the field. Besides the results of this study indicate that differences in hemp stem chemical composition due to different crop harvest time significantly impacted microbial colonization, biofilm formation and eventually dew retting duration.

However, constraints may arise under light limitation when plants cannot extensively increase photosynthesis. We hypothesize that under such conditions the costs for maintaining the symbiosis outweigh the benefits, ultimately turning the mutualist microbes into parasites, resulting in reduced plant growth and reproduction. Using lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) as an experimental plant, we applied two levels of light (full light, 75% shading) and microbial inoculation (sterile soil, mycorrhizal fungi) and quantified both vegetative and generative plant traits. As expected, shaded plants produced less vegetative biomass and seeds than non-shaded plants. However, individual seeds were significantly heavier in shaded plants and required less time for germination. While under both light conditions mycorrhizal plants showed a significantly reduced belowground biomass, mycorrhizal fungi neither enhanced overall plant performance in terms of total biomass and seed production nor resulted in measurable costs in either light condition. Our study suggests that mycorrhizal colonization neither provided benefits to lima bean plants grown under full light, nor created costs when photosynthesis was limited.

Rice plants (cv. Rio Formoso) were grown in pots containing low-Si soil amended with Si at 0, 0.48, 0.96, 1.44, and 1.92 g pot(-1) and inoculated with R. solani at the following days after emergence: 45 (four-leaf stage), 65 (eight-leaf stage), 85 (tillering), 117 (booting), and 130 (panicle exsertion). For plants inoculated with R. solani at all growth stages, Si concentration in straw increased as rate of Si increased from 0 to 1.92 g pot(-1). Concentration of calcium in the straw did not differ among plant growth stages. Although incubation period was not affected by the amount of Si added to the soil, this variable was shorter at booting and panicle exsertion stages. As the rates of Si increased in the soil, the total number of sheath blight lesions on sheaths and total area under the relative lesion extension curve decreased at all plant growth stages. The severity of sheath blight was lower at booting and panicle exsertion stages as the rates of Si increased in the soil. In general, plants grown in Si-nonamended pots and inoculated with R. solani were more vulnerable to infection at all growth stages, but especially at 45 days after emergence. Plant dry weights for inoculated plants increased as the Si rates increased from 0 to 1.92 g pot(-1). The greatest dry weight increases occurred for plants inoculated at booting and panicle exsertion stages. Si fertilization is a promising method for controlling sheath blight in areas where soil is Si deficient and when cultivars that exhibit an acceptable level of resistance to sheath blight are not available for commercial use.

Viggiani (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), causing flower gall on Clinopodium nepeta (L.) Kuntze (Lamiaceae), is described from Europe. The morphological characteristics of adult, larvae, and pupa are described and illustrated. Molecular approach (by sequencing 28S-D2, ITS2, and COI) confirmed that A. nepetae is a distinct species. The development of the gall is always associated with the presence of the fungus Botryosphaeria dothidea (Moug.: Fr.) Ces. and De Not. (Botryosphaeriales: Botryosphaeriaceae). The new species can complete several generations per year, on the flowers of the same host plant and its adults emerge from late spring to autumn. Pupae overwinter inside peculiar flower galls in a state of quiescence. The impact of the pest is highly variable with a percentage of flowers infested that ranged between 3 and 57.5% in the sampled years. Insect mortality was, at least in part, due to parasitoids that attack the young stages of the midge. Among them, the dominant species was Sigmophora brevicornis (Panzer) (Chalcidoidea: Eulophidae).

Plant dry weight was not affected by any of these treatments although the number and weight of nodules was reduced at 50 and 30% SFC. Nitrogenase activity, determined by the acetylene reduction assay (ARA), was also reduced, on a plant basis, at 50% SFC and was almost stopped at 30% SFC. The latter treatment caused a marked increase in nodule O-2, diffusion resistance and induced nodule senescence. A time-course analysis of the IO d 30% SFC treatment showed a decrease in leaf water potential from -0.5 to -0.87 MPa by 8 d, with a cessation of dry weight increase after 3 d, when leaf water potential was -0.65 MPa. Proteins in the host plant fraction of nodules decreased to 50% of control values by 10 d and leghaemoglobin (Lb) content was also lower at this stage. The activity of sucrose synthase (SS) showed a 76% reduction between 3 and 6 d, whilst glutamate synthase (GOGAT) activity showed a 40% reduction. The activity of other key enzymes of carbon metabolism was also reduced after 10 d. Nodule sucrose content increased to double that of control nodules by 6 d, before declining back to control levels at 10 d. Starch content fell by 3 d and continued to fall throughout the stress period. The results are discussed in terms of drought tolerance strategies in relation to growth and metabolism in whole plants and nodules. (C) 1999 Annals of Botany Company.

Weather factors associated with development of sorghum ergot in the Texas Panhandle	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							CLAVICEPS-AFRICANA; DISEASE; VARIABLES; RAINFALL; AMERICA	Since its first introduction in 1997, sorghum ergot, caused by Claviceps africana, has been observed yearly in the Texas Panhandle, where it has caused occasional epidemics in hybrid-seed production fields. To determine the effect of weather factors on ergot severity, inoculation experiments were conducted in 2003 and 2004 using sequentially planted sorghum plants. Sorghum flowers were inoculated with three inoculum concentrations (1 x 10(4), 1 x 10(5), or 1 x 106 spores/ml) prepared from infected sorghum particles producing fresh honeydew. Each year, inoculations were conducted several times during sorghum flowering periods so that time of inoculations would coincide with different weather conditions. Weather variables (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and radiation) were collected using an onsite weather station. Infected and uninfected florets were counted 8 to 13 days after inoculation, and the percentage of infected florets per sorghum particle (severity) was determined. In both years, temperature and relative humidity were the predominant factors responsible for variations in sorghum ergot severity with all inoculum densities. Relationship between ergot severity and each of the two variables depended on inoculum density. Measurable infection occurred at a maximum temperature of 34 degrees C with 1 x 10(6) spores/nil, while there was little or no infection at 30 degrees C with 1 x 10(4) spore/ml. Cumulative departures from minimum relative humidity and maximum temperature infection thresholds 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h after inoculation were calculated and regressed against ergot severity for each inoculum level. Cumulative departures of hourly temperature and relative humidity from maximum temperature and minimum relative humidity infection thresholds 18 and 24 h after inoculation were best related to sorghum ergot severity (R-2 = 89 and 91; P < 0001, respectively). Models based on these two time-durations then were used in predicting a regional site-specific ergot severity potential using radar-estimated rainfall.

Frameworks for life-history strategies have been successfully applied to describe changes in plant and animal communities upon disturbance. To evaluate their applicability to complex bacterial communities, we operated replicated wastewater treatment bioreactors for 35 days and subjected them to eight different disturbance frequencies of a toxic pollutant (3-chloroaniline), starting with a mixed inoculum from a full-scale treatment plant. Relevant ecosystem functions were tracked and microbial communities assessed through metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Combining a series of ordination, statistical and network analysis methods, we associated different life-history strategies with microbial communities across the disturbance range. These strategies were evaluated using tradeoffs in community function and genotypic potential, and changes in bacterial genus composition. We further compared our findings with other ecological studies and adopted a semi-quantitative competitors, stress-tolerants, ruderals (CSR) classification. The framework reduces complex data sets of microbial traits, functions and taxa into ecologically meaningful components to help understand the system response to disturbance and hence represents a promising tool for managing microbial communities.

Few assisted migration trials have considered limitations of the cooler climates and pathogens currently present at transplant sites. This is especially important to consider in riparian ecosystems that are priority targets for restoration in the western United States as they harbor diverse communities. In an effort to validate assisted migration as an effective strategy for mediating the negative impacts of climate change, we used a provenance trial with replicated genotypes from 19 populations of the foundation riparian tree species, Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), transplanted to a cold site to test for genetic variation in growth, mortality, and resistance to shoot blight fungi (Venturia sp.). Populations from cool sites had up to 4 times faster growth, 3 times higher survival, and 8 times higher resistance to Venturia than populations from warm sites, providing evidence of local adaptation to both climate and pathogenic fungi. Budburst phenology and shoot blight were correlated with frost damage, subsequent shrub-form architecture, and mortality. While climate change models predict 6 degrees C increases, plants transferred distances of 6 degrees C at this time would not perform well; an intermediate transfer distance of less than 3 degrees C would avoid maladaptation to the current environment during assisted migration. Thus, multiple and intermediate transfer phases to supplement local genetic variation will likely be necessary for effective assisted migration to accommodate current environments and large changes in climate.

'Fern' during 2006 and 2007. All bacterial root inoculations significantly increased yield per plant (1.98-20.85%), average fruit weight (3.05-19.26%) and first quality fruit ratio (10.30-32.05%) compared to control, whereas the bacterial inoculations did not affect leaf area, first flowering and harvest dates in strawberry cv. 'Fern'. The bacteria also increased soluble solid content (SSC) and vitamin C in strawberry cv. 'Fern'. The vitamin C contents of fruits ranged from 47.41 mg 100 g(-1) (control) to 53.88 mg 100 g(-1) (RC05), while SSC values varied between 10.16% (control) and 12.83% (RC01).

Fungal pathogens, insects and mammals are the enemy types most commonly hypothesised to cause this phenomenon. Still, their relative importance remains largely unknown, as robust manipulative experiments have generally targeted a single enemy type and life history stage. Here, we use fungicide, insecticide and physical exclosure treatments to isolate the impacts of each enemy type on two life history stages (germination and early seedling survival) in three tropical tree species. Distance dependence was evident for five of six species-stage combinations, with each enemy type causing distance dependence for at least one species stage and their importance varying widely between species and stages. Rather than implicating one enemy type as the primary agent of this phenomenon, our field experiments suggest that multiple agents acting at different life stages collectively contribute to this diversity-promoting mechanism.

Plants were inoculated 21 days after style emergence; wounded grains and adjacent spikelets (with their rachis segments) were harvested at intervals up to 28 days later. Tissues were processed for plastic embedding and 1.5-mu-m thick sections were examined by bright field microscopy. The fungus spread from the wound sometime after 14 days postinoculation, and at 28 days postinoculation it could be found in small amounts throughout all rachis tissues except the pith and lignified fibers. The fungus entered the rachillae of adjacent spikelets from the rachis and also from the bracts at their insertion point. The fungus grew through the aerenchyma in the rachilla to the floral axis and innermost layers of the pericarp (the endocarp). Hyphae did not penetrate to the endocarp from the exterior of the pericarp. The hyphae were always intercellular in the rachis, rachilla, and pericarp. They were both inter- and intracellular in the floral axis and internal to the testa (i.e., inside the seed proper). From the endocarp, entry into the seed was not across the black layer; random tears in the testa over the embryo were the probable immediate pathway. Hyphae were vacuolate everywhere except in the seed. Host cells died (and even collapsed) ahead of the fungus, but no other structural alterations were seen.

Cell survival on seeds of cultivar BRS Guariba treated or not with fungicides (fludioxonil, carbendazim, carbendazim + thiram, and carboxin + thiram) and inoculated or not with Bradyrhizobium (strains UFLA3-84, BR 3267, INPA3-11B, and BR 3262) were evaluated in laboratory. Another experiment was carried out in greenhouse, in Leonard jars, using the same treatments. The following were evaluated: shoot dry matter weight, besides number and dry matter weight of nodules 25 days after plant emergence. Two experiments were performed in the field with the strain BR 3262, with fungicides on the seeds: one in a first cultivation area and the other in an area previously cultivated with annual crops. Nodule number, nodule dry weight, and shoot dry matter weight were evaluated at 35 days, and grain yield at harvest.

CULTIVARS; JAPONICA-RICE; TOLERANCE; HUMIDITY; HOT	Background and Aims High temperatures over 32-36 degrees C at anthesis induce spikelet sterility in rice. The use of a germplasm with an early-morning flowering (EMF) trait has been hypothesized as a way of avoiding this problem. In this study, the effect of the EMF trait on avoiding high temperature-induced sterility at anthesis by flowering at a cooler temperature in the early morning was evaluated. Methods The EMF trait was introgressed from wild rice (Oryza officinalis) into the rice cultivar 'Koshihikari' (O. saliva). First, spikelets of the EMF line and Koshihikari were subjected to rising temperatures during the daytime in the greenhouse to test for differences in spikelet sterility. Secondly, spikelets of both plants were exposed to 26, 34 and 38 degrees C at anthesis and to 38 degrees C beginning at least 1 h after flowering, in the growth chambers at 70% relative humidity, to test for differences in tolerance to high temperatures. Key Results Spikelets of the EMF line started and completed flowering a few hours earlier than Koshihikari. In a greenhouse experiment, spikelets of Koshihikari opened after the air temperature reached 35 degrees C, but those of the EMF line could open at cooler temperatures. Under these conditions, spikelet sterility significantly increased in Koshihikari, but did not in the EMF line. The number of sterile spikelets increased as their flowering time was delayed in Koshihikari. Furthermore, the chamber experiments revealed that 60% of the spikelets from both lines were sterile when exposed to 38 degrees C at anthesis, indicating that tolerance of high temperature was similar in both genotypes. Conclusions Reduced sterility in the EMF line subjected to rising temperatures at anthesis in the greenhouse was attributed to an earlier flowering time compared with Koshihikari. The EMF trait of wild rice is effective in mitigating anticipated yield loss due to global warming by escaping high-temperature stress at anthesis during the daytime.

Although effects of organic fertilizers on soil bacteria in the rhizosphere can differ from those in non-rhizosphere soil, microbiological studies that specifically address the rice rhizosphere still limited. This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of organic fertilizers on soil bacteria communities through comparison of rhizosphere soils and bulk soils. Effects of soil types and seasonal change were also analyzed. Rice plants (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) were cultivated in a lowland paddy field of Andosol soil. Applications of compost and rice bran in combination with chemical fertilizer were compared with control soil (chemical fertilizer only). Soil 16S rDNA extracted from rhizosphere soil collected using ultrasonic treatment of rice roots and from bulk soils were analyzed using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Principal component analysis based on PCR-DGGE profiles revealed clear differences in the community structures of soil bacteria between rhizosphere and bulk soils. Furthermore, rhizosphere bacterial community structures of compost and rice bran treatments were plainly different from that of control, and changed with the seasons. The organic fertilizers showed pronounced effects on bacterial communities until mid-summer, but small effects in autumn. Results of this study suggest that the rhizosphere microorganisms in paddy fields can be modified through organic fertilizer management. Moreover, effects of organic fertilizer application, soil type, and phenology on soil bacteria appear depending on interaction with the rice rhizo-sphere effects in paddy fields.

Despite its wide distribution and its proven significance at the level of individuals, communities, and populations, the ability to form mycorrhizal associations has been largely neglected in these studies so far. Analyzing plant traits associated with the occurrence of mycorrhizas in plants can therefore enhance our understanding of plant strategies and distributions. Using a comparative approach, we tested for associations between mycorrhizal status and habitat characteristics, life history traits, and plant distribution patterns in 1752 species of the German flora (a major part of the Central European flora). Data were analyzed using log-linear models or generalized linear models, both accounting for phylogenetic relationships. Obligatorily mycorrhizal (OM) species tended to be positively associated with higher temperature, drier habitats, and higher pH; and negatively associated with moist, acidic, and fertile soils. Competitive species were more frequently OM, and stress tolerators were non-mycorrhizal (NM), while ruderal species did not show any preference. Facultatively mycorrhizal (FM) species showed the widest geographic and ecological amplitude. Indigenous species were more frequently FM and neophytes (recent aliens) more frequently OM than expected. FM species differed markedly from OM and NM species in almost all analyzed traits. Specifically, they showed a wider geographic distribution and ecological niche. Our study of the relationships between mycorrhizal status and other plant traits provides a comprehensive test of existing hypotheses and reveals novel patterns. The clear distinction between FM and OM+NM species in terms of their ecology opens up a new field of research in plant-mycorrhizal ecology.

Little is known about the environmental drivers of mushroom productivity and phenology, partially because the life cycle of fungi is mostly belowground. Here, we present results from a field survey, in which a total of 65 631 unique individual mycorrhizal mushrooms - representing 273 species - were recorded during weekly intervals from 1975 to 2006 in a nature reserve in Switzerland. The average annual number of observed mushrooms increased from 1313 (pre-1991) to 2730 (1991 and thereafter), while average fruiting time during the latter period was delayed by 10 days as compared with that of the former. Precipitation amounts and temperature means determined fungal activity. Reconstructed intra-annual timing of mushroom fruiting for the 20th century paralleled contemporary Swiss wine harvest dates, providing independent evidence of climate-induced ecosystem change. Enhanced growth conditions and extended growing seasons appear beneficial to fungi from both a socioeconomic and an ecological perspective, because most vascular plants interact with mycorrhizal fungi to generate biomass.

The term Ecological Continuity (EC) has been used to ascribe value to old forest stands. The relative importance of microhabitat and time for colonisation are usually not kept apart when EC is used as a conservation criterium. EC is broadly applied but poorly defined. Use of EC may lead to underestimation of the importance of forest dynamics and dispersal, and to overestimation of the importance of local land use history. If bioindicators of long-term habitat persistence are to be used, species with low dispersal capacity should be chosen. However, many lichens and other fungi, bryophytes and insects cited as indicators of EC, seem to have a patch-tracking lifestyle. They are 'colonists' according to life history strategy classification, and rather seem to indicate specific microhabitats. Terrestrial molluscs, some vascular forest plants, and those bryophytes and lichenized fungi classified as 'perennial stayers' in life history strategy classification, might be used to indicate long-term habitat persistence in forests, but more research is needed to evaluate such indicators.

Role of Grazing Intensity on Shaping Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Communities in Patagonian Semiarid Steppes	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; disturbance level; diversity; ecosystem functioning; grazing; life history strategy	SEASONAL-VARIATION; VASCULAR PLANTS; SOIL CARBON; GRASSLAND; DIVERSITY; GRASSES; COLONIZATION; BIODIVERSITY; VEGETATION; DECOMPOSITION	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are vital for maintaining ecosystem structure and functioning and can be affected by complex interactions between plants and herbivores. Information found in the literature about how ungulate grazing affects AMF is in general contradictory but might be caused by differences in grazing intensities (GIs) among studies. Hence we studied how different GIs affect the composition, diversity, and abundance of AMF communities in a semiarid steppe of Patagonia. We predicted that 1) total AMF spore abundance (TSA) and diversity would decrease only under intense-grazing levels and 2) AMF species spore abundance would depend on their life-history strategies and on the GI. To test our predictions, we compared AMF communities among nongrazed (NG), moderately grazed (MG, 0.1-0.3 sheep ha(1)), and intensely grazed sites (IG, > 0.3 sheep ha(1)). GI was the most important factor driving changes in TSA and diversity, regardless of host plant identity. TSA, diversity, and evenness significantly decreased in IG sites but were not affected by MG. AMF species spore abundance varied depending on their life-history strategies and Gl. Families with high growth rates like Glomeraceae and probably Pacisporaceae showed the highest spore abundance in all sites but decreased under IG. Species with higher carbon demands like Gigasporaceae showed low spore abundance and frequency in NG and MG sites and were absent in IG sites. In contrast, species with low growth rates, but efficient carbon usage, like Acaulosporaceae, showed low spore abundance in all sites but increased in IG sites compared with NG or MG sites. We conclude that intensification of grazing reduces AN' diversity and abundance, with the likely loss of AMF benefits for plants, such as improved nutrient and water uptake and soil aggregation. Therefore, sustainable grazing systems should be designed to improve or restore AMF communities, particularly in degraded rangelands. like the Patagonian steppes.

Up to 14% of plants were affected in individual crops. In experiments, leaf and stem symptoms did not appear until the time of first fruit harvest even when the plants were inoculated at planting, first flowers or fruit set. Conidial inoculum at 10(6) spores/plant applied at seed sowing killed 70-83% of tomato seedlings, whereas similar levels of inoculum applied to young plants caused root and basal stem decay, and eventually death but only after fruit harvest began. Disease incidence and symptom severity increased with inoculum concentration. Experimentally, the disease was more severe in peat- or compost-grown plants than in rockwool. Disease spread was only a few centimetres in 50 days in experimental rockwool-grown plants. All tomato cultivars tested were highly susceptible. Prochloraz-Mn was highly effective against the pathogen in vitro and controlled the disease in the glasshouse, but only when applied preventively. Non-pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum isolates and Trichoderma harzianum also reduced FCRR disease levels.

Chickpea variety and phenology affect acquisition of Pea enation mosaic virus, subsequent plant injury and aphid vector performance	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY			English	Article						Crop phenology; legumes; pea aphid; PEMV; pulse crops; virus acquisition	RESISTANCE; TRANSMISSION	Acquisition of Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) by chickpea (Cicer arietinum) when fed on by viruliferous pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) was tested for combinations of two chickpea varieties ('Bronic', a kabuli type and 'Sierra', a desi type) and three plant ages (14, 28 and 42 days after germination). It was determined whether inoculation with PEMV influenced plant growth and yield components, and the effect of variety x age combinations on the survival and fecundity of aphid vectors was evaluated. Three important findings emerged: (a) Acquisition of PEMV by chickpea depended on plant age. When inoculated at 14 or 28 days, most plants tested positive for PEMV at harvest, while rates of virus acquisition were reduced for 42 day-old plants. (b) Plant age at inoculation affected growth and yield parameters, and this effect differed between chickpea varieties. For both varieties, PEMV infection reduced plant height and biomass at harvest when plants were inoculated at 14 days. Only 'Sierra' exhibited significant reductions in plant height and biomass when inoculated at 28 days. Seed set was severely diminished for both varieties when plants were inoculated at 14 and 28 days after germination, but mature plants were not damaged in terms of growth or seed set. (c) The performance of pea aphid was influenced by both chickpea age and variety, with higher fecundities and longer lifespan when colonising 42 day-old plants as compared with younger plants, and better performance overall on 'Sierra'. This study reveals that chickpea can acquire PEMV at all ages tested, but the most damaging effects for growth and yield parameters occur when plants are inoculated at early phenological stages. Chickpea is a poor host for A. pisum in general, but plants can support vector populations long enough for PEMV transmission and subsequent yield reduction to occur.	[Davis, T.

Treatments without inoculation with and without N addition (100 kg ha(-1)) were included. A factorial 2x3x5 was used in a randomized block design with four replicates. Plants were harvested at 110 days after emergence (DAE). Rhizobia inoculation showed significative effect regarding all parameters evaluated, at the lime levels used. M. caesalpiniaefolia did not respond to liming, however when used the level 6.0 ton ha(-1), reduction in dry matter, N total uptake, nodulation and nitrogenase activity occurred. The low pH and high Al3+ in the natural soil did not promote injurious effect on N-2 fixation and on growth of plants inoculated, showing that lime addition is not necessary to M. caesalpiniaefolia tree legume cropped in acid soils when strains selected to acidity are used.

Effect of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices on the false root-knot nematode Nacobbus aberrans in tomato plants	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS			English	Article						Glomus intraradices; Lycopersicon esculentum; Nacobbus aberrans; Nematode reproduction; Mycorrhiza	MELOIDOGYNE-INCOGNITA TYLENCHIDA; BORNE DISEASES; POPULATIONS; PRATYLENCHIDAE; PHOSPHORUS; PENETRANS; GROWTH; SPP.	Information about the interaction between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and the false root-knot nematode Nacobbus aberrans (Thorne, 1935) Thorne & Allen, 1944 is scarce. The effect of Glomus intraradices Schenk & Smith on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) cv. Platense inoculated with nematode juveniles from Lisandro Olmos (Argentina) was studied under greenhouse conditions. Six treatments with five replications were performed. After 80 days, nematode reproduction and percentage of AMF colonization in roots were estimated. Some plant growth parameters were also measured. In general, plants with AMF and AMF plus nematodes grew as well as the control without AMF and without nematodes. Furthermore, G. intraradices was beneficial in reducing nematode-induced damage in roots (lower number of galls) as well as in having a suppressive effect on parasite reproduction. This is the first study on the use of G. intraradices as a possible strategy in the control of N. aberrans in tomato.

Optimal environmental conditions for infection and development of Puccinia purpurea on sorghum	AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Artificial inoculation; Darkness period; Leaf wetness period; Plant growth stage; Temperature; Urediniospore concentration	LEAF WETNESS DURATION; TEMPERATURE; RUST; GERMINATION; PERIOD; LIGHT; UREDINIOSPORES	Although rust can reduce grain yields of late-planted sorghum crops in Queensland, little research has been conducted on environmental parameters affecting infection and development. The effects of temperature, leaf wetness period, plant growth stage, urediniospore concentration and darkness period on the development of rust (Puccinia purpurea) on the inbred Sorghum bicolor line IS8525 were evaluated separately by artificial inoculation of plants under controlled conditions. Rust developed between 16 and 28 A degrees C, with the optimum temperature being 20 A degrees C. Disease severity (pustules cm(-2)) increased as the length of leaf wetness increased from 4 to 24 h. Infection occurred when plants were exposed to full light, full darkness and varying periods of darkness for the first 24 h after inoculation; 16 h of darkness resulted in the highest rust severity. Plants of IS8525 and of the more resistant line IS12539 inoculated 21-49 days after sowing developed higher levels of rust than others inoculated at, or close to, flowering (63 days after sowing). Rust severity also increased with increasing urediniospore concentrations, but leaf death occurred on young plants inoculated with the highest concentration (50 mg 100 mL water(-1)). The findings of this study have been used to develop an inoculation technique to detect putative pathotypes of P. purpurea in Australia.	[White, J. A.; Ryley, M.

J	198	MW	Scholles, D; Vargas, LK				Scholles, D; Vargas, LK			Viability of soybean inoculation with Bradyrhizobium strains in flooded soil	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO			Portuguese	Article						nodulation; biological nitrogen fixation; lowland	TOLERANCE; MANGANESE; RESPONSES; STRESS; EXCESS; YIELD	Soybean can be a viable alternative crop for lowlands. However, soybean relies on biological nitrogen fixation, a process that is normally affected by soil flooding, depending on the macrosymbiont genotype. Moreover, the behavior of different bradyrhizobia strains in flooded soil is yet unknown. The present research aimed to evaluate the efficiency of Bradyrhizobium elkanii and Bradyrhizobiumjaponicum strains recommended for soybean in comparison to mineral nitrogen fertilization, in flooded soil. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, where soybean cultivar CEP 20 was sown in pots with soil. The treatments applied were either inoculation with one of the Bradyrhizobia strains: SEMIA 587, SEMIA 5019, SEMIA 5079 or SEMIA 5080, or the application of 100 mg kg(-1) mineral nitrogen at two soil moisture levels - 100% of field capacity or flooded with a 1 cm-water layer on the soil surface. The soil was flooded 14 days after plant emergence and it was maintained under such conditions for 30 days. The nodule number and dry matter, and shoot dry matter were evaluated at 46 and 75 days after plant emergence. The amount of accumulated nitrogen in the soybean shoot was determined 75 days after plant emergence. Soil flooding reduced the nodule number and dry mass in both evaluation periods. There was no difference in the soybean shoot dry matter among the plants inoculated with distinct bradyrhizobia strains, which accumulated less dry matter than the treatment with mineral nitrogen. However, in the second evaluation period the treatment with mineral nitrogen accumulated less dry matter in the flooded soil as compared to the same treatment in soil at field capacity. The amount of nitrogen accumulated in the shoot was also lower in the flooded soil. Results show that the process of nitrogen fixation is affected by soil flooding, hobut, when waterlogging cease nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation is recovered. Plants fertilized with mineral nitrogen are also affected by soil flooding.

Plant functional traits help to understand management impact on rich fen vegetation	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE			English	Article						functional traits; mowing; mycorrhiza; nature conservation; Poland; red-list species; rich fen; species richness; Sphagnum	LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT; ASSEMBLY PROCESSES; MEADOWS; DISTURBANCE; COMPETITION; DIVERSITY; DATABASE; CONSEQUENCES; REPRODUCTION	Questions Fens are important conservation targets in temperate Europe. When hydrologically undisturbed, fens remain open for millennia. However, unaltered fens are scarce, and today their biodiversity largely depends on conservational mowing applied to prevent successional shifts. However, the effects on community structure and conservation values are uncertain, and management might not always be needed where it is a priori applied by managers. Thus, within the presented study, we ask the following questions: (a) How is the species and functional composition of fens influenced by mowing? (b) Does mowing increase the conservation value of fen ecosystems? Location Lowland fens, northern Poland. Methods The sample consisted of 27 pairs of mown and unmown plots, located within ten sites. Ordination methods were used to assess the influence of mowing on species composition. Functional traits related to competitiveness, flowering time, mycorrhizal associations and functional groups were used to characterize plant communities and species richness, and the number of specialist and red-listed species was used to evaluate conservation values. Differences between mown and unmown plots were assessed using linear mixed-effect models and the effect size approach. Results Management of fens suppresses the growth of trees, shrubs and highly competitive herbaceous species and inhibits the encroachment of Sphagnum mosses. At the same time, it enhances the establishment of species from other ecosystems (grasses, ruderal species, species of drier sites) within fens and alters the microtopography of the fen surface. Conclusions Mowing can enhance species richness and the presence of rich fen specialists in transformed sites, but it can lead to fen ecosystem deterioration towards managed meadow communities within sites sustaining many typical fen species and functional characteristics.

Factors that affect embryo rescue from crossed seeds between diploid and tetraploid grape were studied applying L(25)(5(5)) orthogonal experiment design. The effect of inoculation time, medium type and phytohormone concentration was investigated. The chromosome numbers of the progenies were identified by conventional squash method. The results show that inoculation time was the key factor that affects embryo rescue. Other factors' effects differed according to the combination. The best inoculation time was 55 to 80 days after pollination, which lead to the highest emergence rate of 39.13% to 73.08%. The generation of triploid plants was proved by chromosome number measurement.

Seeds from four cotton cultivars with different levels of resistance were sown in plastic containers in greenhouse conditions. At 20 days after emergence, plants were inoculated with a suspension at 1 x 10(6) conidia/mL of Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides. Leaves were collected at 3, 15 and 30 days after inoculation and free proline, catalase, peroxidase, soluble carbohydrates and total proteins were determined. Proline, peroxidase and catalase levels discriminated the reaction of infected plants. These descriptors changed soon after infection and the change was more evident in the resistant BRS Antares variety. Free proline and catalase descriptors can be used in the identification of ramulosis-resistant cultivars in cotton breeding programs.	[Silva, Fabiana A. C.; Granja, Manuela M.

Relating Urban Biodiversity to Human Health With the 'Holobiont' Concept	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						ecosystem services; immune; holobiont; microbiome; non-communicable disease; restoration ecology; biophilic cities; urban	GUT MICROBIOME; FRESH-WATER; BACTERIAL MICROBIOTA; RESPIRATORY-TRACT; DRINKING-WATER; PUBLIC-HEALTH; SOIL; RISK; RESTORATION; DISEASE	A relatively unaccounted ecosystem service from biodiversity is the benefit to human health via symbiotic microbiota from our environment. This benefit occurs because humans evolved alongside microbes and have been constantly exposed to diverse microbiota. Plants and animals, including humans, are organised as a host with symbiotic microbiota, whose collective genome and life history form a single holobiont. As such, there are interdependencies between biodiversity, holobionts, and public health which lead us to argue that human health outcomes could be improved by increasing contact with biodiversity in an urban context. We propose that humans, like all holobionts, likely require a diverse microbial habitat to appropriate resources for living healthy, long lives. We discuss how industrial urbanisation likely disrupts the symbiosis between microbiota and their hosts, leading to negative health outcomes. The industrialised urban habitat is low in macro and microbial biodiversity and discourages contact with beneficial environmental microbiota. These habitat factors, alongside diet, antibiotics, and others, are associated with the epidemic of non-communicable diseases in these societies. We suggest that restoration of urban microbial biodiversity and micro-ecological processes through microbiome rewilding can benefit holobiont health and aid in treating the urban non-communicable disease epidemic. Further, we identify research gaps and some solutions to economic and strategic hurdles in applying microbiome rewilding into daily urban life.

The bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum (strain BR 3267) was inoculated in cowpea seeds from the cultivar IPA 206 and, 35 days after germination, the plants were subjected to different water availability regimes and to heat stress under greenhouse conditions. To identify differentially expressed genes, the cDNA-AFLP technique was used, and 67 differentially expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were isolated. After TDFs sequencing and similarity analyses, using the Blastx program, 14 differentially expressed genes were identified, which are involved in different metabolic processes. The expression pattern of six genes under abiotic stress conditions was confirmed by RT-qPCR, and the induction of different functional gene categories, such as abscisic acid biosynthesis, cell signaling, proline transporter, and lipid membrane biosynthesis, was observed. The expression of these genes indicates their participation in processes related to nodule protection under abiotic stresses.

Four experiments were carried out in Brazil: two in the North Region, in an already-cultivated area and in a first-crop area; one in the Central-West Region; and one in the Southeast Region. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replicates. The treatments consisted of the following cell densities of the BR 3267 strain or of the BR 3262 strain: 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 2.4x10(6) colony-forming units (CFU) per seed, plus the control treatment without inoculation and with the addition of nitrogen fertilization (70 kg ha(-1) N). The evaluated variables were nodule dry weight, shoot dry weight, and dry grain yield (13% moisture). To assess nodulation, five plants were collected sequentially at 30-35 days after emergence in the second row of each plot. Nodulation responded positively to the increase in rhizobia cell density applied to the seeds. There was a linear increase in plant nodulation with the increase of inoculation density; however, not necessarily with a response in shoot biomass. The highest grain yield occurs at a density of at least 1.2x10(6) colony-forming units per seed.

Since foraging strategies of wild animals are affected by phenological changes, gut microbial communities would differ among seasons. However, interactions of plant-animal-microbiota with seasonal changes have not been well characterized. Here, we surveyed gut microbial diversity of Siberian flying squirrels (Pteromys volans orii) from a natural forest in Hokkaido during spring and summer of 2013 and 2014. Additionally, we compared microbial diversity to temperature changes and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Changes in both seasonal temperature and phenology were significantly associated with alterations in gut microbiota. There were two clusters of OTUs, below and above 20 degrees C that were significantly correlated with low and high temperatures, respectively. Low-temperature cluster OTUs belonged to various phyla, whereas the high-temperature cluster was only constituted by Firmicutes. In conclusion, gut microbiota of Siberian flying squirrels varied with environmental changes on an ecological scale.

In this study, six Phaseolus vulgaris recombinant inbred lines (RILs), i.e. RILs 115, 104,34 (P deficiency tolerant) and 147, 83, 70 (P deficiency sensitive), were inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT899, and hydroaeroponically grown with P-sufficient (250 mu mol P plant(-1) week(-1)) versus P-deficient (75 mu mol P plant(-1) week(-1)) supply. Two harvests were done at 15 (before nodule functioning) and 42 (flowering stage) days after transplanting. Nodulation, plant biomass, P and N contents, and the ratios of N-15 over total N content (N-15/Nt) for shoots, roots and nodules were determined. The results showed lower N-15/Nt in shoots than in roots, both being much lower than in nodules. P deficiency caused a larger decrease in N-15/Nt in shoots (-0.18%) than in nodules (-0.11%) for all of the genotypes, and the decrease in shoots was greatest for RILs 34 (-0.33%) and 104 (-0.25%). Nodule N-15/Nt was significantly related to both the quantity of N-2 fixed (R-2= 0.96***) and the P content of nodules (R-2= 0.66*). We conclude that the discrimination against N-15 in the legume N-2-fixing symbiosis of common bean with R. tropici CIAT899 is affected by P nutrition and plant genotype, and that the N-15/Nt in nodules may be used to screen for genotypic variation in P use efficiency for N-2 fixation.

Deriving Economic Models for Pea Aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae) as a Direct-Pest and a Virus-Vector on Commercial Lentils	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						field and forage crop; pest management; vector-borne pathogen-plant; IPM-agricultural	AGE-RELATED RESISTANCE; FIELD PEAS; PLANT; HOMOPTERA; GROWTH	The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), presents a dual threat to commercial pulse growers because it can inflict direct injury through feeding and indirect injury as a vector of two important viruses, Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) and Bean leafroll virus (BLRV). A decision support system is needed to help producers manage both of these threats in pulses. To address these gaps in lentil, Lens culinaris (Medikus) (Fabales: Fabaceae), we conducted field experiments near Moscow, Idaho in 2011 and 2012 with three objectives: 1) determine economic injury levels (ElLs) for pea aphid in lentil based on the direct effects of their feeding on yield, 2) develop economic guidelines for treating aphids carrying PEMV or BLRV based on the impact on yield of virus inoculation at different times after crop emergence, and 3) provide a framework for using both of these decision tools as part of a comprehensive approach to pea aphid management in lentil. ElLs were determined based on data from replicated field cage trials over 2 yr. Windows of economic vulnerability to viruses were determined based on artificial inoculation with viruses at different days after crop emergence over 2 yr. Both direct and indirect injury support tools can be parameterized with potential yields, market prices, and the costs of insecticide applications to guide treatment decisions.Together, the two tools comprise a decision support system for managing pea aphid acting as both a direct pest and as a vector of the viruses in lentils in the Palouse region of northern Idaho and southeastern Washington State.

Research suggests that disturbance-tolerant taxa may be represented by fungi in the Glomerales, those in culture collections, and by cosmopolitan taxa due to their generalist growth habit. The corollary is that these taxa should be less common in undisturbed systems. Although widely accepted, these ideas originate from research conducted in previously disturbed systems. Whether they hold up to comparisons of disturbed versus undisturbed systems remains to be seen. We addressed this question by surveying logged and intact sites within forests dominated an AM fungal host (western redcedar; Thuja plicata). We predicted that old-growth sites would host fewer taxa from the Glomerales, fewer cultured taxa, and fewer cosmopolitan taxa compared to logged sites. Contrary to our predictions, the logged and intact sites did not differ with respect the putative disturbance-tolerant taxa. However, taxonomic composition differed, driven primarily by variation in relative abundance rather than loss or gain of taxa. Multiple analyses of indicator taxa revealed no consistent indicators of either undisturbed or disturbed habitats. Based on these findings, the current paradigm for a phylogenetically based LHS of AM fungi warrants re-examination. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Hormaphidinae is a particular aphid group exhibiting very diverse life history traits. However, the microbiota in this group is poorly known. In the present study, using high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons, we surveyed the bacterial flora in hormaphidine aphids and explored whether the aphid tribe, host plant and geographical distribution are associated with the distribution of secondary symbionts. The most dominant bacteria detected in hormaphidine species are heritable symbionts. As expected, the primary endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola is the most abundant symbiont across all species and has cospeciated with its host aphids. Six secondary symbionts were detected in Hormaphidinae. Arsenophonus is widespread in Hormaphidinae species, suggesting the possibility of ancient acquisition of this symbiont. Ordination analyses and statistical tests show that the symbiont composition does not seem to relate to any of the aphid tribes, host plants or geographical distributions, which indicate that horizontal transfers might occur for these symbionts in Hormaphidinae. Correlation analysis exhibits negative interference between Buchnera and coexisting secondary symbionts, while the interactions between different secondary symbionts are complicated. These findings display a comprehensive picture of the microbiota in Hormaphidinae and may be helpful in understanding the symbiont diversity within a group of aphids.

This first disulfide bond ties a large Cys loop, which in the cholinesterases is named the omega loop and forms the upper part of the active center gorge, essential for the high catalytic activity of these enzymes. In some non-catalytic members of the family, the loop may be necessary for heterologous partner recognition. Reshuffling of this protein portion occurred at the time of emergence of the fungi/metazoan lineage. Homologous proteins with this first disulfide bond are absent in plants but they are found in a limited number of bacterial genomes. In prokaryotes, the genes coding for such homologous proteins may have been acquired by horizontal transfer. However, the cysteines of the first disulfide bond are often lost in bacteria. Natural expression in bacteria of CO-esterases comprising this disulfide bond may have required compensatory mutations or expression of new chaperones. This disulfide bond may also challenge expression of the eukaryote-specific cholinesterases in prokaryotic cells. Yet recently, catalytically active human cholinesterase variants with enhanced thermostability were successfully expressed in E. coli. The key was the use of a peptidic sequence optimized through the Protein Repair One Stop Shop process, an automated structure-and sequence-based algorithm for expression of properly folded, soluble and stable eukaryotic proteins. Surprisingly however, crystal structures of the optimized cholinesterase variants expressed in bacteria revealed co-existing formed and unformed states of the first disulfide bond. Whether the bond never formed, or whether it properly formed then broke during the production/analysis process, cannot be inferred from the structural data. Yet, these features suggest that the recently acquired first disulfide bond is difficult to maintain in E. coli-expressed cholinesterases. To explore the fate of the first disulfide bond throughout the cholinesterase relatives, we reanalyzed the crystal structures of representative COesterases members from natural prokaryotic or eukaryotic sources or produced as recombinant proteins in E. coli. We found that in most cases this bond is absent.

J	218	NG	Del Fabbro, C; Prati, D				Del Fabbro, Corina; Prati, Daniel			Early responses of wild plant seedlings to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and pathogens	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						AMF; arbuscular mycorrhiza; conyza; Interacting effects; Inula; Mycorrhizal function; Protection; Pathogen; Pythium ultimum; Senecia; Solidago	PYTHIUM-ULTIMUM; LIFE-HISTORY; ROOTS; GROWTH; DIVERSITY; COLONIZATION; BIODIVERSITY; PROTECTION; INTENSITY; PROSPECTS	Many plants form associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) because they profit from improved phosphorus nutrition and from protection against pathogens. Whereas mycorrhiza-induced pathogen protection is well understood in agricultural plant species, it is rarely studied in wild plants. As many pathogens infest plants in the first days alter germination, mycorrhiza-induced pathogen protection may be especially important in the first few weeks of plant establishment. Here, we investigated interacting effects of AIVIF and the seedling pathogen P(Ilium ultimum on the performance of six- to seven-week-old seedlings of six wild plant species of the family Asteraceae in a full factorial experiment. Plant species differed in their response to AMF, the pathogen and their interactions. AMU, increased and the pathogen decreased plant biomass in one and three species, respectively. Two plant species were negatively affected by AMU, in the absence, but positively or not affected in the presence of the pathogen, indicating protection by AMF. This mycorrhiza-induced pathogen protection is especially surprising as we could not detect mycorrhizal structure in the roots of any of the plants. Our results show that even seedlings without established intraradical hyphal network can profit from AMF, both in terms of growth promotion in the absence of a pathogen and pathogen protection. The function of AMF is highly species-specific, but tends to be similar for more closely related plant species, suggesting a phylogenetic component of mycorrhizal function. Further studies should test a wider range of plant species, as our study was restricted to one plant family, and investigate whether plants profit frotn early tnycorrhizal benefits in the long term.

Overwintered second-instar budworm larvae from a laboratory colony or from a wild population were placed on endophyte positive or negative trees one or two weeks before budburst. The presence of the endophyte in the needles reduced the survival of C. fumiferana from both a wild population and a laboratory colony. Survival for budworm juveniles up to pupation and to adult emergence was 13% and 17% lower, respectively, on endophyte positive trees. The endophyte did not influence the size or sex of survivors and budworm survival was not influenced by any two- or three-way interactions. Budworm survival was higher for wild than for laboratory-reared budworm and for budworm placed on trees a week before budburst. This may be the first field study to demonstrate the efficacy of an endophytic fungus against wild individuals of a major forest insect pest. The efficacy of the endophyte at low larval densities suggests that it could be a useful tactic to limit spruce budworm population growth in the context of an early intervention strategy.

A two-phase experiment was conducted twice to investigate the effects of soil management on movement of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium in tomato plants. In the first phase, individual leaflets of 84 tomato plants grown in conventional or organic soils were dip inoculated two to four times before fruiting with either of two Salmonella Typhimurium strains (10(9) CFU/ml; 0.025% [vol/vol] Silwet L-77). Inoculated and adjacent leaflets were tested for Salmonella spp. densities for 30 days after each inoculation. Endophytic bacterial communities were characterized by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis before and after inoculation. Fruit and seed were examined for Salmonella spp. incidence. In phase 2, extracted seed were planted in conventional soil, and contamination of leaves and fruit of the second generation was checked. More Salmonella spp. survived in inoculated leaves on plants grown in conventional than in organic soil. The soil management effect on Salmonella spp. survival was confirmed for tomato plants grown in two additional pairs of soils. Endophytic bacterial diversities of tomato plants grown in conventional soils were significantly lower than those in organic soils. All contaminated fruit (1%) were from tomato plants grown in conventional soil. Approximately 5% of the seed from infested fruit were internally contaminated. No Salmonella sp. was detected in plants grown from contaminated seed.	[Gu, Ganyu; Cevallos-Cevallos, Juan M.; van Bruggen, Ariena H.

Interactive Effects of Contact Fungicide and Cold Stratification on the Germination Rate for Five Dominant Temperate Tree Species	FOREST SCIENCE			English	Article						Captan 50W; germination fraction; germination rate; Pinaceae; survival analysis	PLANT-DISEASE MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEED-GERMINATION; FOREST HEALTH; PINE SEED; PATHOGENS; SEEDLINGS; DENSITY; HABITAT	Fungicide application facilitates seed and seedling survival, but these pesticides may also negatively affect germination. Moreover, it is unclear how fungicide may interact with influential environmental conditions, such as cold stratification, to affect tree seed germination. We examined how fungicide and five different cold stratification durations of increasing length influenced tree seed germination (i.e., germination fraction and germination rate) for five important species commonly found in temperate North American forests (Abies balsamea, Acer saccharum, Picea glauca, Pinus resinosa, and Pinus strobus). Greater cold stratification durations increased A. saccharum germination fraction, had positive effects on P. strobus and A. balsamea germination fractions, and decreased germination for P. glauca. Longer cold stratification reduced time to germination for all species, reinforcing the importance of this pregermination condition in tree seed phenology. We also found that although Captan 50W fungicide had no effect on the germination fraction for any species, it delayed the germination of P. glauca and P. strobus at specific stratification durations. We suggest that delays in tree seed germination-mediated by fungicide application, reductions in stratification duration driven by warmer winters, or both-could hinder seedling survival and performance with long-term effects on the vigor of tree seedlings used for transplanting.

However, the mechanisms involved in the interaction between H. seropedicae and these plants are not completely characterized. We investigated the attachment of Herbaspirillum to maize roots and the invasion of the roots by this bacterium using H. seropedicae strain SMR1 transformed with the suicide plasmid pUTKandsRed, which carries a mini- Tn5 transposon containing the gene for the Discosoma red fluorescent protein (Dsred) constitutively expressed together with the kanamycin resistance gene. Integration of the mini- Tn5 into the bacterial chromosome yielded the mutant H. seropedicae strain RAM4 which was capable of expressing Dsred and could be observed on and inside fresh maize root samples. Confocal microscopy of maize roots inoculated with H. seropedicae three days after germination showed that H. seropedicae cell were attached to the root surface 30 min after inoculation, were visible in the internal tissues after twenty-four hours and in the endodermis, the central cylinder and xylem after three days.

Nevertheless, their taxonomy has remained largely unresolved, and phylogenetic affinities among gelechioid families and lower taxa have been insufficiently understood. We constructed, for the first time, a comprehensive molecular phylogeny for the Gelechioidea. We sampled seven genes, in total 5466 base pairs, of 109 gelechioid taxa representing 32 of 37 recognized subfamilies, and two outgroup taxa. We used maximum likelihood methods and Bayesian inference to construct phylogenetic trees. We found that the families Autostichidae, Lecithoceridae, Xyloryctidae, and Oecophoridae s. str., in this order, are the most basally arising clades. Elachistidae s. I. was found to be paraphyletic, with families such as Gelechiidae and Cosmopterigidae nested within it, and Parametriotinae associated with several families previously considered unrelated to them. Using the phylogenetic trees, we examined patterns of life history evolution and determinants of the success of different lineages. Gelechioids express unusually wide variability in life-history strategies, including herbivorous, saprophagous, fungivorous, and carnivorous lineages. Most species are highly specialized in diet and other life history traits. The results suggest that either saprophagy was the ancestral feeding strategy from which herbivory evolved independently on multiple occasions, or that the ancestor was herbivorous with repeated origins of saprophagy. External feeding is an ancestral trait from which internal feeding evolved independently several times. In terms of species number, saprophages are dominant in Australia, while elsewhere several phytophagous lineages have extensively specialized and diversified. Internal feeding has remained a somewhat less generally adopted feeding mode, although in a few lineages significant radiations of leaf mining species have occurred. We conclude that diverse feeding modes, specialization among saprophages, repeated shifts to phytophagy, and a generally high specialization rate on single plant species (monophagy) are the major factors behind the success of the Gelechioidea.

Starved cultures were resuscitated by addition of yeast extract or peptones plus vitamins, but they were not reactivated by the complete medium or glucose or vitamins alone. Investigations on plant exudates showed that amino-nitrogen as well as carbohydrates are excreted in very restricted amounts at certain times during the maturation of grass.

We examined how MN facilitation varied with seedling provenance by planting interior Douglas-fir seed and nursery-grown seedlings near the crown edge of mature conspecific trees along a climatic stress gradient. Survival of outplanted nursery seedlings was greatest for the medium moisture provenance, but decreased with drought more rapidly than the wet or dry provenances. The driest provenance performed best under severe drought, but the survival of all provenances was still less than 35% under severe drought. Survival, growth and delta C-13 of seedlings grown from seed or in the nursery were not affected by MNs. We conclude that seedling genetic and life history effects outweigh benefits that MNs may incur upon Douglas-fir seedling performance under conditions of severe drought. Selection of appropriate provenances and robust growing stock will become of increasing importance for regenerating sites where drought is expected to increase with climate change.

As nutritional imbalance in food intake may affect the performances of herbivores, the latter have evolved a variety of physiological mechanisms to cope with the challenges of digesting their plant-based diet. Some of these strategies involve living in association with symbiotic microbes that promote the digestion and detoxification of plant compounds or supply their host with essential nutrients missing from the plant diet. In Lepidoptera, a growing body of evidence has, however, recently challenged the idea that herbivores are nutritionally dependent on their gut microbial community. It is suggested that many of the herbivorous Lepidopteran species may not host a resident microbial community, but rather a transient one, acquired from their environment and diet. Studies directly testing these hypotheses are however scarce and come from an even more limited number of species. By coupling comparative metabarcoding, immune gene expression, and metabolomics analyses with experimental manipulation of the gut microbial community of prediapause larvae of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia, L.), we tested whether the gut microbial community supports early larval growth and survival, or modulates metabolism or immunity during early stages of development. We successfully altered this microbiota through antibiotic treatments and consecutively restored it through fecal transplants from conspecifics. Our study suggests that although the microbiota is involved in the up-regulation of an antimicrobial peptide, it did not affect the life history traits or the metabolism of early instars larvae. This study confirms the poor impact of the microbiota on diverse life history traits of yet another Lepidoptera species. However, it also suggests that potential eco-evolutionary host-symbiont strategies that take place in the gut of herbivorous butterfly hosts might have been disregarded, particularly how the microbiota may affect the host immune system homeostasis.

The 72 samples studied were commercially available in Italy and Spain, where they were brought from Panama, Ecuador and Canary Islands. Among the species detected in the fruits, Fusarium semitectum var. majus Wollenw. was predominant, followed by F. moniliforme Sheld., F. solani (Mart.) Appel & Wollenw., F. oxysporum Schlecht., F. proliferatum (Matsushima) Nirenberg, F. graminearum Schw., F. camptoceras Wollenw. & Reinking, F. subglutinans (Wollenw. & Reinking) Nelson et al., F. dimerum Penzig in Sacc., F. acuminatum Ell. & Ev., and F. equiseti (Corda) Sacc. Fusarium proliferatum had never been reported to occur as contaminating fungi in banana fruits to date. Fusarium subglutinans, F. acuminatum and F. graminearum were found to be the most markedly pathogenic of all. The lack of noticeable differences in relation to the incidence of the different species isolated from the samples indicates that the mycoflora found is typical of this fruit and does not depend on its origin.

Grain was harvested about 33 days after anthesis. Seedborne fungi were determined from 300 seeds from each seed lot. The most frequently isolated fungi were Fusarium semitectum (26% of seed), Alternaria spp. (19%), and Curvularia spp. (13%). Total Fusarium isolations, including F. semitectum, averaged 46%. Isolation frequencies of several fungi were related to weather conditions 2-4 wk prior to harvest. Aflatoxins were detected from grain planted in both years, and concentrations averaged 0.3 ng/g. Deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, zearalenone, and 15-acetylscirpentriol were detected only in the 1991 samples, and levels averaged 0.3, 1.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mug/g, respectively, Isolation of F. chlamydosporum was positively correlated (r greater-than-or-equal-to 0.66) with concentrations of trichothecenes and zearalenone. Although pearl millet grown in Georgia does not appear to be prone to infection by Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin contamination, a potential for problems from infection by toxigenic Fusarium species does exist.

In the present study, the effects of root exudates from watermelon plants inoculated or non-inoculated with either SQR-21 or FON on conidial germination of FON were investigated. Compared to the control, conidial germination was decreased with root exudates from SQR-21-inoculated plants, but conidial germination was enhanced by root exudates from FON-inoculated plants. Maximal germination was found with root exudates from FON-inoculated plants after 30 d, which was 1.35 times more germination than the control. A split-root system was designed to verify that the alterations of the exudation pattern in SQR-21- inoculated or FON-inoculated watermelon roots were not only local, but also systemic. Cinnamic acid was found in the watermelon root exudates. An assay to test the effects of cinnamic acid on conidial germination of FON revealed that the stimulation of conidial germination was observed from cinnamic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 mu g/ml. In conclusion, both of SQR-21 and FON systemically affects watermelon root exudates. These results will help to the better understanding of the plant-microbe communication and will guide to improve the biocontrol strategies against Fusarium wilt of watermelon plants.

Different date palm characteristics including; harvesting time, color and taste of fruits, diversity in fruit, stone weight, length and diameter, variation in chemical composition, sugar, minerals and amino acids contents were recorded by standard methods. Results indicated that there was slightly to highly significant variations among the investigated parameters in different cultivars. Further that microbial burden (cfu/g) on four fruit sizes classes (large, small, medium and mixed) in three fruit processing techniques (unpressed-unpitted, pressed-pitted and unpressed-pitted date fruits) were examined The results revealed that the different date varieties showed different load of microbial infections. On the basis of all investigated parameters the fruit performance index (FPI) and valuation classes were calculated. The consequences indicated that the Begamjangi score highest grade point (6) and stood in excellent class, followed by Haleeni with grade point 4.0 and categorized in good class. Other two date cultivars Dashtri and Peshnah score 2.0 & 1.0 grade points and classified into poor and very poor group of date palm fruits, respectively.	[Aslam, A.; Leghari, S.

To test this hypothesis, black bean plants were grown in sterilized sand to simulate soil physical properties, were fertilized with increasing Mn concentrations (0.1-20 mu M) and inoculated with a commercial mixture of Rhizobium leguminosarum by phaseoli strains 127K44, 127K89, 127K105 (+Rh), in combination with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Scutellospora heterogama and Entrophospora colombiana (+AMF). Non-inoculated plants fertilized with 6 mM NO3 and 2 mM P served as controls. Plants were harvested at 18, 25, 33, and 40 days after emergence. At all harvests, the greatest growth and highest P and iron (Fe) leaf concentrations occurred in control plants grown in 5 mu M Mn. The growth of +AMF plants was promoted at 0.1 mu M Mn and inhibited at higher than 1 mu M Mn. Whereas, concentrations of 5-10 mu M Mn enhanced the growth and the Mn concentrations in leaves of +Rh plants 40 days after emergence. The tripartite symbiosis (+Rh+AMF) decreased growth, nodulation and leaf ureide and chlorophyll concentrations in plants grown in less than 20 mu M Mn, imputed to severe ultrastructural alterations in the leaf and nodule tissues. Only +Rh+AMF plants grown in 20 AM Mn were effectively nodulated, AMF colonized and reached the flowering stage, although with diminished growth and low chlorophyll concentrations. Results confirm the high Mn requirement of +Rh plants for growth and nodulation and question the implementation of the tripartite symbiosis to improve yields in early flowering black bean varieties planted in soils deficient in Mn and P.

Consistent trade-offs in fungal trait expression across broad spatial scales	NATURE MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; WOOD; SUCCESSION; STRESS; GROWTH; CLASSIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; GENOMICS; NICHE	Fungi are the primary agents of terrestrial decomposition, yet our understanding of fungal biogeography lags far behind that of plants, animals and bacteria. Here, we use a trait-based approach to quantify the niches of 23 species of basidiomycete wood decay fungi from across North America, and explore the linkages among functional trait expression, climate and phylogeny. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between abiotic stress tolerance and competitive ability, whereby fungi with wide thermal and moisture niches exhibit lower displacement ability. The magnitude of this dominance-tolerance trade-off is partially related to the environmental conditions under which the fungi were collected, with thermal niche traits exhibiting the strongest climate relationships. Nevertheless, moisture and thermal dominance-tolerance patterns exhibited contrasting phylogenetic signals, suggesting that these trends are influenced by a combination of niche sorting along taxonomic lines in tandem with acclimation and adaptation at the level of the individual. Collectively, our work reveals key insight into the life history strategies of saprotrophic fungi, demonstrating consistent trait trade-offs across broad spatial scales.

JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Protease activity; Pyricularia grisea; crude extract; antifungal activity; mycelial growth	ALKALINE PROTEASE	Rice blast is a dangerous disease that causes major damage to rice productivity worldwide. The purpose of this report is to examine the protease activity of Pyricularia grisea and the effects of Commelina communis L. (common name day flower) extract on mycelial growth. The result showed that three isolates were collected from wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) based on a designation of new international standard and namely as U43-i4-k024-z05-ta532 (isolate 1); U12-i0-k101-z05-ta102 (isolate 2) and U43-i4-k141-z15-ta522 (isolate 3). Particularly, the third isolate showed the highest protease enzyme activity of 30.11 U/ml, followed by isolate 1 (20.27 U/ml) and isolate 2 (12.81 U/ml). The new fungi isolated from wild rice may be important methods to control detrimental diseases infesting cultivated rice. The result showed methanol extract from the day flower inhibitions on P.grisea. Besides protease activity, fungi inhibition was also affected. The protease activity was low; the mycelial growth inhibition was high (IC50 = 2.35mg/mL at Isolate 2). Plant extracts from the day flower saved money and were environmentally friendly. So the implementation of this substance is very essential.

Commercial bumble bees, Bombus impatiens, were tested as vectors of the fungicidal biological control agents, Prestop (R) (Gliocladium catenulatum) and Mycostop (R) (Streptomyces griseoviridis), against blueberry blossom blight. A single bumble bee hive and four flowering blueberry plants were confined within each of ten 1.5-m(3) insect exclusion cages. Test products were applied onto the bodies of worker bees exiting each hive through a tubular V-shaped dispenser containing the test product affixed to the hive's entrance. Dissected floral parts were plated onto agar and recovery frequency of biological control agents was determined. Stylar infection rates were 100% for S. griseoviridis and 70% for G. catenulatum. In field trials, bumble bees vectored a UV-fluorescent dye and biological control agents to about one-third of the open blueberry flower clusters in a small field in as few as 8 days. Flowers were inoculated with B. cinerea 10 days after placing biological control agent vectoring bee hives in the field. The inoculated flowers on bee-visited stems (Prestop treated flowers) had more white corollas (71%) and a lower disease incidence than unvisited flowers (52% white corollas). These results indicate that bumble bees can vector sufficient biological control agent to blueberry flowers to reduce floral damage caused by B. cinerea, however, disease control may not have sufficient economic impact under high disease pressure.

These organisms are pioneer colonizers of submerged litter derived from the terrestrial surroundings, and through their activities, they mineralize litter carbon and nutrients and convert dead organic matter into biomass, establishing the link between basal resources and higher trophic levels. Likewise, soil macrofungi play a key role in forest plant communities as litter and wood decomposers, mycorrhizal symbionts or xyloparasites. High saprotrophic activity determines their significance in providing access to nutrients for other groups of organisms. Here, we address direct and indirect effects of climate change on the community composition, growth, reproduction, metabolism, and decomposing activity of aquatic hyphomycetes, and on the growth, abundance, fruiting phenology, community structure and distribution of terrestrial macromycetes, primarily ectomycorrhizal fungi, but also saprotrophs. Evidence so far suggests that future global climate change will affect aquatic hyphomycete activity and community structure, with consequences for the functioning of woodland streams. Similarly, macromycetes will experience changes in community structure, and shifts in phenology and distribution. The individual responses of ectomycorrhizal fungi to global changes are particularly difficult to address because these fungi depend on host plants and cannot be dissociated from them. We offer several proposals to advance knowledge on the effects of global climate change on these fungi.

FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Aphis fabae; cost; benefit framework; extrafloral-mediated defences; fungal endophytes; mutualism; trade-offs in defence	EXTRA-FLORAL NECTARIES; HERBIVORE EXCLUSION; PLANT; ANT; RESISTANCE; MUTUALISM; GRASSES; COTTON; HOMOPTERA; EVOLUTION	P>There is increasing evidence that extrafloral (EF) nectaries, described in approximately 1000 plant species from more than 90 families, have a defensive function. Endophytic fungi are an important group of microorganisms asymptomatically colonizing host plants, and promoting their defences against natural enemies. We aimed at investigating the role of these microorganisms in inducing EF nectary defences in plants against herbivory. We conducted a full factorial experiment to study the effects of a soil-borne endophytic fungus, Acremonium strictum, alone or in combination with the aphid, Aphis fabae, on the production of EF nectar and nectaries in broad beans. By manipulating the presence/absence of the fungus in the roots of the host plants and by inflicting herbivore damage at a specific time and location, we tested the hypothesis that endophyte inoculation induces EF-mediated indirect defences. The quantity of EF nectar production and the number of EF nectaries produced were assessed by repeated samplings at fixed intervals. Endophytic inoculation of bean plants induced a significant short-term increase in total EF nectar production and a significant prompt increase in number of EF nectaries per expanded leaf. On the other hand, aphid infestation resulted in a prolonged increase in total EF nectar production and a delayed induction of EF nectaries. Conversely, when plants were simultaneously inoculated with the endophyte and infested with aphids, both EF traits were significantly reduced. The effect of endophyte inoculation was further examined by recording the life history traits of Aphis fabae. Aphid performance was generally lower on inoculated plants; however, relative fecundity was the only fitness parameter significantly reduced on endophyte inoculated plants. The organism model in the present study serves as a model for investigating how endophytic colonization alters the response of EF nectary traits to herbivory. From a cost/benefit perspective, variable responses in EF-mediated indirect defences as influenced by endophytes could be explained as trade-offs in defence. In addition, other possibilities that may have contributed to the EF response patterns reported in this study are discussed.

It has been shown that biomass allocation of AM fungi (AMF) among these three propagule types varies between fungal taxa, as also differs the ability of the different AMF propagule fractions to initiate new colonizations. In this study, the composition of the AMF community in the roots of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L., a characteristic Mediterranean shrub), inoculated with the three different propagule types, was analyzed. Accordingly, cuttings from this species were inoculated with either AMF spores, ERM, or colonized roots extracted from a natural soil. The AMF diversity within the rosemary roots was characterized using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of the small subunit (SSU) rDNA region. The AMF community established in the rosemary plants was significantly different according to the type of propagule used as inoculum. AMF taxa differed in their ability to initiate new colonizations from each propagule type. Results suggest different colonization strategies for the different AMF families involved, Glomeraceae and Claroideoglomeraceae colonizing mainly from colonized roots whereas Pacisporaceae and Diversisporaceae from spores and ERM. This supports that AMF taxa show contrasting life-history strategies in terms of their ability to initiate new colonizations from the different propagule types. Further research to fully understand the colonization and dispersal abilities of AMF is essential for their rational use in ecosystem restoration programs.

Nectar is a crucial energy resource that strongly mediates the interactions between plants and animal pollinators or plant defenders. Previous research has shown that nectar is frequently colonized by microorganisms, most commonly bacteria and yeasts, which can have a strong impact on nectar chemistry. However, at present little is known about the effects of microorganisms on the fitness of animals feeding on nectar. 2. We used three nectar bacteria representing different metabolic groups (Asaia sp., Lactococcus sp. and Rosenbergiella sp.) and the common generalist aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi (Haliday; Hymenoptera: Braconidae) to test the hypothesis that different nectar-dwelling bacteria affect nectar consumption and insect longevity differently by altering the chemistry of nectar. 3. Bacteria significantly affected nectar chemistry by altering its acidity, sugar and amino acids composition/concentration and by adding compounds synthesized by the microbes. Although inoculation with bacteria did not affect nectar consumption, a significant difference in insect longevity was observed. The impact on longevity was species specific, with Lactococcus being beneficial and Asaia having a detrimental effect. 4. Bacteria have a strong impact on nectar chemistry and changes in nectar chemistry may not only influence the foraging behaviour of flower-visiting animals and impact on plant fitness, but also influence the fitness of nectar-consuming organisms. As effects were species dependent, changes in nectar chemistry induced by different bacteria may have contrasting effects on the interactions between plants and insects. It is therefore essential to know how different microbes alter nectar chemistry to understand the relationships between plants, nectar-inhabiting microbes and nectar-consuming animals.

Influence of Seed Endophyte Amounts on Swainsonine Concentrations in Astragalus and Oxytropis Locoweeds	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						locoweed; swainsonine; endophyte; Undifilum; qPCR; inoculation	LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISEASE; EMBELLISIA-OXYTROPIS; FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES; TALL FESCUE; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSMISSION; UNDIFILUM; ALKALOIDS; GOATS; SPP.	Locoism is a toxic syndrome of livestock caused by the ingestion of a subset of legumes known as locoweeds endemic to arid and semiarid regions of the western United States. Locoweeds contain the toxic alkaloid swainsonine, which is produced by the endophytic fungi Undifilum species. Two chemotypes of plants can coexist within toxic populations of locoweeds: chemotype 1 plants are defined as individuals containing swainsonine concentrations greater than 0.01% and quantitatively greater amounts of Undifilum, while chemotype 2 plants are defined as individuals containing less than 0.01% swainsonine and quantitatively smaller amounts of Undifilum. To elucidate the mechanisms that govern chemotypes, the amount of Undifilum in seeds/embryos was manipulated, thus altering subsequent swainsonine concentrations in three locoweed species: Astragalus mollissimus, Astragalus lentiginosus, and Oxytropis sericea. Chemotype 1 seeds that were fungicide-treated or had the seed coat removed resulted in plants with swainsonine concentrations comparable to those in chemotype 2 plants. Conversely, embryos from seeds of chemotypes 1 and 2 that were inoculated with the endophyte resulted in plants with swainsonine concentrations comparable to those of chemotype 1 plants. This reproducible interconversion between the two swainsonine chemotypes suggests that the quantity of endophyte present in the seed at the time of germination is a key determinant of the eventual chemotype. Additionally, this is the first report of the inoculation of locoweeds with the endophyte Undifilum species.

Wheat plants of cultivars BR-18 and BRS-208 were grown in pots containing 0 and 0.30 g Si/kg of soil and inoculated at 45 days after emergence. Spot blotch severity was evaluated at 48, 72, and 96 hours after inoculation and data were used to calculate the area under spot blotch progress curve (AUSBPC). The Si and calcium concentrations on leaf tissue were also determined. The Si concentration on leaf flag of plants supplied with Si was 90.5% higher compared to plants non-supplied with this element. Spot blotch severity was significantly lower on leaf flags of plants supplied with Si at all evaluation times. There was a reduction of 58.5% in AUSBPC on leaf flag of plants supplied with Si. There was no significant difference between -Si and +Si treatments for calcium concentration on leaf tissue. There was no significant difference between the two cultivars for Si concentration on leaf tissue and AUSBPC, but calcium concentration on leaf tissue was higher for cultivar BR-18 than for cultivar BRS-208. The correlation between Si concentration on leaf tissue and AUSBPC was negative (r = -0.59). The results of this study showed a positive effect of Si on increasing wheat leaf flag resistance against infection by B. sorokiniana, considering the importance of this leaf in particular for a gain in yield.

Results showed that disease incidence and lesion diameter in mature pears from trees sprayed with ASM for three times during growth and inoculated with Penicillium expansum or Alternaria alternata after harvest were 27.9 and 42.7%, or 29.1 and 23.4% lower, respectively, than in control fruit 17 days after inoculation. Mature fruit from ASM-treated trees exhibited higher activities of defense enzymes including phenytalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase than in control at harvest. In young pears, activities of peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase, PAL, chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase were significantly enhanced by ASM after first spray on trees. The ASM spray also significantly increased H2O2 level and glutathione reductase activity, but reduced activities of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase in young pears. The study indicated that enhancement of disease resistance in harvested Yali pear fruit could be the result of multiple effects of several factors related to plant defenses induced by ASM sprays on trees during fruit growth. Application of ASM in the field holds great promise for controlling postharvest diseases of the fruit. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Bean plants were either inoculated with a strain of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli (UMR-1899), a vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus (Glomus etunicatum) or were left non-inoculated (controls). At two harvests (21 and 28 days post-emergence), extracts containing soluble proteins and free amino acids were prepared from leaves, roots and nodules of field beans. Nodulated plants contained a significantly higher concentration of protein and amino acids in all plant parts. Nitrogen-fixing beans invested a significantly greater proportion of total N as protein-N and amino acid-N as compared to VAM or control beans. Abundant nodule-specific proteins (nodulins) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), identified and quantified using scanning densitometry. Rio Tibagi nodules contained a significantly lower concentration of glutamine synthetase (GS) subunits than did Mexico 309 nodules. Glutamate synthase (GOGAT) and GS activities were low relative to other legumes. The transferase/synthetase ratio for GS was also low indicating that the synthetase activity was saturated and was operating at maximal level in these young N2-fixing associations. Specific nodule activity (SNA) and the level of GS were correlated (r = 0.90, p < 0.05) for both cultivars at both harvests. GS activity was only 8 or 24% higher than SNA in nodules of Mexico 309 or Rio Tibagi cultivars, respectively, under conditions where substrate was not limiting. This suggests that early in the functioning of this symbiosis N assimilation by GS is the rate-limiting step in N2 fixation by these two bean cultivars, each with a different symbiotic efficiency. Phaseolus breeding programs that attempt to improve N2 fixation in beans should identify germplasm that expresses elevated levels of nodule-specific GS or GOGAT, and this material should be used along with effective R. leguminosarum bv. phaseoli strains that have already been selected, to determine superior host-microsymbiont associations.

Wounded fruit were inoculated in the field at 2 to 3 weeks preharvest with mycelium from 14- to 21-day-old cultures. In the laboratory, detached fruit were inoculated similarly. Fruit were rated for relative susceptibility to the fungus by determining disease severity of attached fruit in the field based on lesion growth (mm/degree-day) and detached fruit in laboratory inoculations of wounded fruit (mean lesion diameter after 4 days). Based on the laboratory and field data from two growing seasons, cultivars were classified into three relative susceptibility groups-most susceptible: 'Orin', 'Pristine', and Sunrise'; moderately susceptible: 'Suncrisp','Ginger Gold','Senshu','Honeycrisp','PioneerMac', 'Fortune', NY75414,'Arlet','Golden Supreme','Shizuka','Cameo','Sansa', and 'Yataka'; and least susceptible: 'Creston', 'Golden Delicious', 'Enterprise', 'Gala Supreme', 'Brae-burn', 'GoldRush', and 'Fuji'.

Phytoremediation was done for mitigation of heavy metals i.e. Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb) and Cadmium (Cd) from contaminated soils of agricultural significance. Phytoremediant crops were inoculated with fungal cultures by three methods i.e. mixing method, seed inoculation method and layering spreading method. Maize and sunflower plants after fungal inoculation were harvested after 60 days of germination. The estimation of % biomass and bioenergy of maize and sunflower plants was done. Results were indicative of the good phytoremediation potential of roots and shoots for uptake of heavy metals i.e. CrAspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus flavus by fungal inoculation methods. Sunflower and fungal inoculum of Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium chrysogenum extracted significant quantity of metals from the soil. By three fungal inoculation methods, range of % production of biomass was 84-87% and sunflower plants dry biomass 9.6 g yielded 0.16% of oil. Obtained results are have favored the use of fungal inoculation as an effective mode for phytoremediation augmentation of maize and sunflower. Furthermore, current work also signifies the sustainable conversion of bioenergy crops to biofuel production in a cost effective mode.

Extended larval development time for aphid parasitoids in the presence of plant endosymbionts	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Aphidius ervi; development time; host-parasitoid interactions; larval mortality; life-history traits; longevity; Metopolophium festucae; multitrophic interactions; Neotyphodium lolii; sex ratio	FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES; LISTRONOTUS-BONARIENSIS; MICROCTONUS-HYPERODAE; NATURAL ENEMIES; COLEOPTERA-CURCULIONIDAE; MULTITROPHIC INTERACTION; HYMENOPTERA-BRACONIDAE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; INSECT HERBIVORES; RESISTANCE	1. Variation in plant chemistry does not only mediate interactions between plants and herbivores but also those between herbivores and their natural enemies, and plants and natural enemies. 2. Endophytic fungi complete their whole life cycle within the host plant's tissue and are associated with a large diversity of plant species. Endophytes of the genus Neotyphodium alter the chemistry of the host plant by producing herbivore toxic alkaloids. 3. Here we asked whether the endophyte-tolerant aphid species Metopolophium festucae could be defended against its parasitoid Aphidius ervi when feeding on endophyte-infected plants. In a laboratory experiment, we compared life-history traits of A. ervi when exposed to hosts on endophyte-infected or endophyte-free Lolium perenne. 4. The presence of endophytes significantly increased larval and pupal development times, but did not affect the mortality of immature parasitoids or the longevity of the adults. Although the number of parasitoid mummies tended to be reduced on endophyte-infected plants, the number of emerging parasitoids did not differ significantly between the two treatments. 5. This shows that the metabolism of individual aphids feeding on infected plants may be changed and help in the defence against parasitoids. An increase in parasitoid development time should ultimately reduce the population growth of A. ervi. Therefore, endophyte presence may represent an advantage for endophyte-tolerant aphid species through extended parasitoid development and its effect on parasitoid population dynamics.

Internal Colonization of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium in Tomato Plants	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ESCHERICHIA-COLI O157-H7; O-ANTIGEN CAPSULE; MULTISTATE OUTBREAK; AGGREGATIVE FIMBRIAE; IRRIGATION WATER; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; ALFALFA SPROUTS; UNITED-STATES; CELLULOSE; SURVIVAL	Several Salmonella enterica outbreaks have been traced back to contaminated tomatoes. In this study, the internalization of S. enterica Typhimurium via tomato leaves was investigated as affected by surfactants and bacterial rdar morphotype, which was reported to be important for the environmental persistence and attachment of Salmonella to plants. Surfactants, especially Silwet L-77, promoted ingress and survival of S. enterica Typhimurium in tomato leaves. In each of two experiments, 84 tomato plants were inoculated two to four times before fruiting with GFP-labeled S. enterica Typhimurium strain MAE110 (with rdar morphotype) or MAE119 (without rdar). For each inoculation, single leaflets were dipped in 10(9) CFU/ml Salmonella suspension with Silwet L-77. Inoculated and adjacent leaflets were tested for Salmonella survival for 3 weeks after each inoculation. The surface and pulp of ripe fruits produced on these plants were also examined for Salmonella. Populations of both Salmonella strains in inoculated leaflets decreased during 2 weeks after inoculation but remained unchanged (at about 10(4) CFU/g) in week 3. Populations of MAE110 were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those of MAE119 from day 3 after inoculation. In the first year, nine fruits collected from one of the 42 MAE119 inoculated plants were positive for S. enterica Typhimurium. In the second year, Salmonella was detected in adjacent non-inoculated leaves of eight tomato plants (five inoculated with strain MAE110). The pulp of 12 fruits from two plants inoculated with MAE110 was Salmonella positive (about 10(6) CFU/g). Internalization was confirmed by fluorescence and confocal laser microscopy. For the first time, convincing evidence is presented that S. enterica can move inside tomato plants grown in natural field soil and colonize fruits at high levels without inducing any symptoms, except for a slight reduction in plant growth.

This work proposed to evaluate the effect of increasing NaCl levels in the soils under Spondias tuberosa plants colonized with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Under greenhouse conditions, Spondias seeds were going placed to germinate in trays with mycorrhizal soil and in trays with soil autoclavado. The germination occurred 15 days after the planting and in the 30(th) cultivation day, the plants were going transferred to plastic vases with capacity for 2 L of nutritious solution with the next NaCl doses: 0, 100 and 150 mM. They were monitored the transpiration rate and stomatal conductance until the plants introduced toxicity symptoms to the Na+. After the saline stress suspending, they were evaluated the N, P, K, S, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl contents in the drought matter of the aerial part (stem + leaves) and root. It was going observed the reduction in radicular phytomass and aerial in NaCl first-level regarding the control. Stomatal conductance in plants not micorrizadas was equally reduced. In the root, it was observed significant reductions in Ca, K and Mg contents for the mycorrhizal plants and not mycorrhizal. In the leaves, the increase of NaCl dose induced a substantial reduction in the Ca, Mg and N contents and probably it was caused the reduction in the mass drought production.

The Rhyme chert also provides the first unequivocal evidence in the fossil record of fungal interactions that can in turn be compared with those in modern ecosystems. These interactions in the Rhynie chert involve both green algae and macroplants, with examples of saprophytism, parasitism, and mutualism, including the earliest mycorrhizal associations and lichen symbiosis known to date in the fossil record. Especially significant are several types of specific host responses to fungal infection that indicate that these plants had already evolved methods of defence similar and perhaps analogous to those of extant plants. This suggests that mechanisms underlying the establishment and sustenance of associations of fungi with land plants were well in place prior to the Early Devonian. In addition. a more complete understanding of the microbial organisms involved in this complex ecosystem can also provide calibration points for phylogenies based on molecular data analysis. The richness of the microbial community in the Rhyme chert holds tremendous potential for documenting additional fungal groups, which permits speculation about further interactions with abiotic and biotic components of the environment.

Resistance induction using acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) has presented promising results in the management of diseases, but to plant-parasitic nematodes the time required to activate latent defense mechanisms is a limiting factor, which can be prevented with the treatment of seedlings in trays. Thus, the present study aimed to assess different times of ASM application to Meloidogyne javanica control in lettuce. Lettuce seedlings were produced in trays, transplanted to pots 25 days after germination and inoculated with 2000 eggs of the nematode. The seedlings were pulverized on shoots with ASM 10 or 5 days before of transplant (DBT), on the day of transplant (DT), 5 or 10 days after transplant (5 or 10 DAT), 10 DBT+DT and 10 DBT+5 DAT. The untreated plants formed the control group. Fifty days later, these plants were collected and evaluated the nematological and vegetative parameters. The treatments promoted a decrease in M. javanica population higher than 60% when applied until 5 DAT and generally did not interfere with the vegetative parameters of lettuce, and ASM can be adopted as an alternative for the root-knot nematodes management.

Specificity of plant response to different AM fungal species is a prerequisite for AM fungal composition to have an effect on plant community dynamics. We test determinants of specificity of plant response to AM fungi across six early-and six late-successional tallgrass prairie plants by growing them with one of seven different AM fungal species and a non-inoculated control. We found that late-successional species were more responsive, and demonstrated greater specificity, toward individual AM fungal taxa than early-successional species. There was no phylogenetic signal for plant responsiveness or specificity of plant response. Phylogenetic multiple regressions indicated that successional stage, plant growth rate, and overall responsiveness were significant predictors of fungal specificity independent of shared phylogeny. These results suggest that plant response to mycorrhizal fungi is evolutionarily labile and coevolves with plant life history. Our results also suggest that AM fungal community dynamics can be particularly important for the establishment and subsequent dynamics of late-successional plants.

Sampling in a long-term field experiment was carried out in order to understand the impact of long-term differences in P fertilization on secretion of organic anions under field conditions. Rhizosphere organic anions were extracted and analyzed every week from three leaves stage to completed flowering stage of wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown on plots that have received 0 (P0) or 48 (P48) kg P ha(-1) year(-1) since 1966. The study showed that it is possible to extract and quantify rhizosphere organic anions from field plots. In P48 plots, root P concentrations decreased around 40 % at the early stages (before heading), compared with the first sampling, and then increased slightly, while plants grown in P0 plots showed the opposite trend. Malate was the main organic anion secreted throughout all the wheat growth stages. Rhizosphere citrate and malate showed negative and positive correlations (P<0.05) respectively with root P concentrations at 29 and 42 days after emergence (DAE). Rhizosphere organic anion concentrations were quite low until 29 DAE and then increased up to 4-10-fold until 42 DAE; these concentrations declined at later stages, indicating that root-released organic anions may have been affected by developmental stage and root P concentration. The present study provides valuable information about the relationship between rhizosphere organic anions and various P concentrations of wheat grown in the field.

Interrelationship of Organic Acids and Aluminum Concentrations in Rhizosphere and Nonrhizosphere Soil Solution of Rice in Acidic Soil	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						Aluminum; complexation; dry matter; organic acids; rice; root aluminum; root volume; shoot aluminum	HUMIC SUBSTANCES; AMINO-ACIDS; PLANT-ROOTS; TOXICITY; CITRATE; MECHANISMS; ADSORPTION; RESISTANCE; CADMIUM; DETOXIFICATION	To study the interrelationship of organic acids and aluminum concentrations in rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soil solution of rice (var. Satabdi and IR 64) in acidic soil, plants were grown in plastic pots containing 500 g soil. Three organic acids (viz., tartaric, oxalic, and citric acids) were identified and quantified in rice rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere soils. Organic acids were found more in the rhizosphere soil and at early stages of crop growth, decreased sharply after 30 days of germination, and found in negligible quantity after 45 days of germination. Regression analysis revealed a significant and negative relationship between solution aluminum and organic acid. Satabdi showed greater organic acid concentration in rhizosphere soil, leading to significantly lower root and shoot aluminum concentrations and consequently significantly greater dry-matter production as well as root volume, compared to IR 64. The findings established that organic acids can effectively reduce aluminum concentration in soil solution.	[Pal, Sharmistha; Datta, S. C.; Reza, S.

Mycorrhizal response trades off with plant growth rate and increases with plant successional status	ECOLOGY			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; growth rate; prairie; root architecture; succession; trade-offs	FUNGAL COMMUNITIES; ROOT ARCHITECTURE; METAANALYSIS; DEPENDENCE; DYNAMICS; COLONIZATION; RESTORATION; ASSOCIATION; VEGETATION; EVOLUTION	Early-successional plant species invest in rapid growth and reproduction in contrast to slow growing late-successional species. We test the consistency of trade-offs between plant life history and responsiveness on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We selected four very early-, seven early-, 11 middle-, and eight late-successional plant species from six different families and functional groups and grew them with and without a mixed fungal inoculum and compared root architecture, mycorrhizal responsiveness, and plant growth rate. Our results indicate mycorrhizal responsiveness increases with plant successional stage and that this effect explains more variation in mycorrhizal response than is explained by phylogenetic relatedness. The mycorrhizal responsiveness of individual plant species was positively correlated with mycorrhizal root infection and negatively correlated with average plant mass and the number of root tips per unit mass, indicating that both plant growth rate and root architecture trade off with investment in mycorrhizal mutualisms. Because late-successional plants are very responsive to mycorrhizal fungi, our results suggest that fungal community dynamics may be an important driver of plant succession.

The immature development, survivorship and adult reproduction of the weevil were investigated on four popular mango cultivars (Langra, Amrapali, Fazli and Ashwina) under the laboratory conditions and life-table parameters were estimated. The immature developmental periods ranged from 17.3 to 19.8 days with female ratio of 5.5-6.2. Ault longevity ranged 43.6 days for female and 66.2 days for males. Effects of the host plant varieties were not significant on the immature development or sex ratio, but significantly influenced the adult performances; longevity, reproduction and also life table parameters. Among the mango varieties tested, Ashwina variety could be the most preferable with higher population growth rate while the Langra and Fazli were the lesser suitable with longer doubling time or lower reproduction. Further study could pursue the nutritional and antibiotic mechanisms which could be responsible for the different performance of the herbivore insect on the mango plants.

Differentiating between effects of invasion and diversity: impacts of aboveground plant communities on belowground fungal communities	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; congener; diversity; exotic; native; perennial grass; saprophytic fungi	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; SOIL BIOTA; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; CENTAUREA-MACULOSA; USE EFFICIENCY; ENEMY RELEASE; T-RFLP; RESOURCE; GRASS	P>Exotic plant species can affect soil microbial communities with the potential for community and ecosystem feedbacks. Yet, separating the effects of exotics from confounded changes in plant community diversity still remains a challenge. We focused on how plant diversity and native or exotic life history affected root fungi because of their significant roles in community and ecosystem processes. Specifically, we examined how fungi colonizing plant roots were affected by plant richness (one, two or four species) replicated across a range of plant community mixtures (natives, exotics, native-exotic mixtures). Fungal biomass inside roots was affected independently by plant richness and mixture, while root fungal community composition was affected only by plant richness. Extraradical networks also increased in size with plant richness. By contrast, plant biomass was a function of plant mixture, with natives consistently smaller than exotics and native-exotic mixtures intermediate. Plant invasions may have an impact on the belowground community primarily through their effects on diversity, at least in the short-term. Disentangling the effects of diversity and invasion on belowground microbial communities can help us to understand both the controllers of belowground resilience and mechanisms of successful colonization and spread of exotic plants.

Against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris by Antagonistic Rhizobacteria in Assistance with Native Mesorhizobium	CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							PLANT-GROWTH; MACROPHOMINA-PHASEOLINA; PATHOGENIC VARIABILITY; SCLEROTIUM-ROLFSII; WILT; RHIZOSPHERE; BIOCONTROL; SUPPRESSION; MECHANISMS; PROMOTION	In the present study five potent rhizobacterial antagonists of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris alone and in combination with Mesorhizobium (M) were evaluated for their potential to elicit the defence response reactions to reduce the total loss of plants and enhance the growth of two chickpea cultivars i.e. resistant GPF-2 and susceptible JG-41. Observations revealed that maximum phenolic, peroxidase (PO) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity was induced after 30th day of germination. Maximum phenol concentration of 745.8 and 724.1 mu g/gfw root tissues was recorded by Ps45 when co-inoculated with Mesorhizobium in both the varieties i.e. GPF-2 and JG-41 respectively. Isolates Ps45, Ps47 and Ps44 were found most promising to induce PO and PPO activity, in combination with Mesorhizobium and recorded superior over the fungicide with respect to negative control. Similar results were recorded for the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), maximally induced on 20th day after germination, where dual inoculation of Ps44+M and Ps45+M induced 57.0 and 54.2 nmol of cinnamic acid min(-1) gfw(-1) in GPF-2. However in case of JG-41, Ps45 and Ba1a exhibited highest PAL activity of 54.2 and 41.4 nmol of cinnamic acid min(-1) gfw(-1). Malonic aldehyde concentration in stem tissues at 30th day revealed that lipid peroxidation was effectively reduced in rhizobacterial treated plants compared to fungicide and negative control, signifying the role of antagonistic plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in reducing the stress and enhancing the plant's defence response to reduce the disease incidence and thus improving the plant growth and yield. Moreover the dual inoculations were observed superior over the fungicide treatment as well as single inoculations in terms of growth (root/shoot length and weight), signifying the synergistic effect of screened antagonists and native Mesorhizobium in suppressing the pathogen and thereby enhancing the plant growth.

The root systems were evaluated by image analysis. In a PVC-tube growth system, inoculation with A. brasilense at 10(7) colony forming units (CFU) ml(-1) increased root length, root projection area, specific root length (m g(-1)) and specific root area (cm(2) g(-1)), as compared with noninoculated controls, resulting in root systems with longer and thinner roots. Water stress induced similar root responses to those observed after inoculation with A. brasilense. No increase in plant biomass was observed in inoculated plants, suggesting that under the tested growth conditions, a relatively larger amount of resources is required for the maintenance of the thinner roots. In water-stressed potted plants, the effect of A. brasilense on tap root length was inoculum-concentration dependent. Rt 10(7) CFU ml(-1) this effect was significant as compared to non-inoculated controls. In a pouch system without water stress, inoculation with A. brasilense at a concentration of 10(5)-10(7) CFU ml(-1) 2 days after germination resulted initially (2 days after inoculation) in an increase in root length (95%) and root fresh weight (66%), but reduced root diameter (20%), compared to controls. At this early stage of growth the distribution of root length among the different root diameter classes changed: the thinner-root classes had the largest, proportion of longer roots.

Screening of edible soybean varieties for resistance to the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, under field conditions	NEMATOLOGY			English	Article						field resistance; susceptible; tolerance		In spite of the economic potential of edible soybean, the crop is attacked by pests and diseases, including the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, which is the most troublesome plant-parasitic nematode in the tropics. Field studies were conducted in 2004 and 2005 to assess the reaction of 34 varieties of soybean for resistance to natural infestation of M. incognita. Ten weeks after planting, ten randomly selected plants were observed for root galls and nodules. Plant height, days to 50% flowering, days to maturity, 100 seed weight and yield were also recorded. Root galling varied significantly among soybean varieties. Root galling correlated negatively with number of pods and leaves; however, there was positive correlation between root gall and stem girth when all 34 varieties were considered. Of the 34 varieties, TGM 344, TGM 1784 and TGX 1448-2E were the most resistant with reproduction factors of 0.54, 0.56 and 0.54, respectively. Ten varieties exhibited tolerance, four were hyper-susceptible while the rest were susceptible to root-knot nematode.

These bacteria can significantly influence the ecology and life history of their hosts. For instance, Arsenophonus nasoniae causes an excess of females in the progeny of parasitoid wasps by selectively killing the male embryos. Other Arsenophonus bacteria have been suspected to protect insect hosts from parasitoid wasps or to expand the host plant range of phytophagous sap-sucking insects. In addition, a few reports have also documented some Arsenophonus bacteria as plant pathogens. The adaptation to a plant pathogenic lifestyle seems to be promoted by the infection of sap-sucking insects in the family Cixiidae, which then transmit these bacteria to plants during the feeding process. In this study, we define the specific localization of an Arsenophonus bacterium pathogenic to sugar beet and strawberry plants within the plant hosts and the insect vector, Pentastiridius leporinus (Hemiptera: Cixiidae), using fluorescence in situ hybridization assays. Phylogenetic analysis on 16S rRNA and nucleotide coding sequences, using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian criteria, revealed that this bacterium is not a sister taxon to Candidatus Phlomobacter fragariae, a previously characterized Arsenophonus bacterium pathogenic to strawberry plants in France and Japan. Ancestral state reconstruction analysis indicated that the adaptation to a plant pathogenic lifestyle likely evolved from an arthropod-associated lifestyle and showed that within the genus Arsenophonus, the plant pathogenic lifestyle arose independently at least twice. We also propose a novel Candidatus status, Candidatus Arsenophonus phytopathogenicus novel species, for the bacterium associated with sugar beet and strawberry diseases and transmitted by the planthopper P. leporinus.

Chemical disinfection was used to destroy bacteria on the root exterior, but bacterial endospores are known for their ability to withstand chemical disinfection, and strain Pw-2 was found to produce 300 to 11,000 times more germinating endospores than strain L6 under the experimental conditions used by Shishido et al. (Can. J. Microbiol. 41:707-713, 1995). Attempts to identify strain Pw-2 within lodgepole pine root tissues by using confocal microscopy techniques failed. We discuss the possibility that spore-forming bacteria can be mistakenly identified as endophytes when culture-based methods alone are used.

Reciprocally plant metabolites can influence major life history traits in these insects and largely contribute to their fitness. Plant rhizospheric microorganisms are an important biotic factor modulating plant metabolites and adaptation to stress. While plant-insects or plant-microorganisms interactions and their consequences on the plant metabolite signature are well-documented, the impact of soil microbial communities on plant defenses against phytophagous insects remains poorly known. In this study, we used oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) as biological models to tackle this question. Even though D. radicum is a belowground herbivore as a larva, its adult life history traits depend on aboveground signals. We therefore tested whether soil microbial diversity influenced emergence rate and fitness but also fly oviposition behavior, and tried to link possible effects to modifications in leaf and root metabolites. Through a removal-recolonization experiment, 3 soil microbial modalities (high, medium, low)were established and assessed through amplicon sequencing of 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA genes. The medium modality in the rhizosphere significantly improved insect development traits. Plant-microorganism interactions were marginally associated to modulations of root metabolites profiles, which could partly explain these results. We highlighted the potential role of plant-microbial interaction in plant defenses against Delia radicum. Rhizospheric microbial communities must be taken into account when analyzing plant defenses against herbivores, being either below or aboveground.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rates and sources of soluble P on nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation in cowpea. The experiment was conducted out in a greenhouse using pots containing a soil collected at 0-20 cm depth. The treatments were disposed in a completely randomized design, factorial 5 x 2 (five rates and two soluble sources of P2O5) and triplicates. The rates consisted of 0, 20, 40, 80 and 160 kg ha(-1) of P2O5 and the sources of P2O5 were the single super phosphate (SSP) and triple super phosphate. The cowpea seeds (BRS-Paraguacu) were inoculated with Bradyrhizobium spp., (strain 3262). The evaluation was carried out at 35 days after plant emergence (DAE), measuring the nodule number and dry matter, shoot and root dry matter, shoot N accumulate and chlorophyll content. There was effect for P sources, rates and interaction of rates and P sources for all variables and the adjusted model was quadratic. The results showed significant correlations among nodulation, chlorophyll and N accumulate of cowpea. The use of SSP provided higher relative efficiency for nodulation and biological nitrogen fixation of cowpea. Independent of P sources, rates between 60 to 80 kg ha(-1) of P2O5, in sandy soils, increase the cowpea growth.

Fundamental knowledge of the ecology of these fungi is therefore essential before the value of such biocontrol methods can be assessed. The ecology of nematode-trapping fungi is reviewed in this chapter. Topics dealt with include occurrence and habitats, geographical and seasonal distribution, quantification of abundance, and effects of soil conditions and nematode density on their distribution. Competition between nematodes and nematophagous fungi, the effect of fungistasis and extreme ecological factors such as heavy metals and salinity on these fungi, and their genetic diversity and speciation are included in this chapter.

Lack of synergistic effects in tomato plants co-infected with tomato severe rugose virus and tomato chlorosis virus	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						mixed infection; plant development; virus titre	CUCUMBER-MOSAIC-VIRUS; BEMISIA-TABACI; CRINIVIRUS; BEGOMOVIRUSES; POTYVIRUS; CROPS; TRANSMISSION; ACCUMULATION; COINFECTION; DISEASES	The begomovirus Tomato severe rugose virus (ToSRV) and the crinivirus Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV), in single and co-infections, are very common in tomato crops in Brazil. Both viruses are transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaciMEAM1 (biotype B). The objective of this study was to analyse the interaction between ToSRV and ToCV in tomato plants of cultivars Santa Clara and Kada. Plants at 15, 30 and 45 days after emergence were inoculated with 30 viruliferous B. tabaci per plant. The following treatments were compared: plants inoculated with ToSRV, ToCV, ToSRV + ToCV, and healthy (control). The interaction between these viruses was analysed by measuring the virus titre by qPCR and the fresh and dry weights of the aerial parts of the tomato plants. Based on two independent assays, no significant effects for co-infection of ToSRV and ToCV on virus titres and plant development were observed compared to single infections. The dry weight of tomato plants of both cultivars infected with ToSRV, ToCV, or co-infected did not differ significantly. However, the dry weight of Santa Clara tomato plants infected with ToSRV, ToCV and ToSRV + ToCV showed mean reductions of 21.5%, 25.5% and 32%, respectively, compared to healthy plants, and mean reductions for Kada were 31.7%, 37.5% and 38%, respectively.

The Hologenime Across Environments and the Implications of a Host-Associated Microbial Repertoire	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						ecology; holobiont ecology; hologenome theory; microbial repertoire; evolution	AMPHIBIAN GUT MICROBIOTA; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; LARVAL DISPERSAL; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; EVOLUTION; DIVERSITY; SYMBIOSIS; PLANT; LIFE	Our understanding of the diverse interactions between hosts and microbes has grown profoundly over the past two decades and, as a product, has revolutionized our knowledge of the life sciences. Through primarily laboratory experiments, the current framework for holobionts and their respective hologenomes aims to decipher the underpinnings and implications of symbioses between host and microbiome. However, the laboratory setting restricts the full spectrum of host-associated symbionts as compared to those found in nature; thus, limiting the potential for a holistic interpretation of the functional roles the microbiome plays in host biology. When holobionts are studied in nature, associated microbial communities vary considerably between conditions, resulting in more microbial associates as part of the hologenome across environments than in either environment alone. We review and synthesize empirical evidence suggesting that hosts may associate with a larger microbial network that, in part, corresponds to experiencing diverse environmental conditions. To conceptualize the interactions between host and microbiome in an ecological context, we suggest the host-associated microbial repertoire, which is the sum of microbial species a host may associate with over the course of its life-history under all encountered environmental circumstances. Furthermore, using examples from both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, we discuss how this concept may be used as a framework to compare the ability of the holobiont to acclimate and adapt to environmental variation, and propose three signatures of the concept.

MACS 330). Soybean plants were grown in the tropical region of Indore (Latitude-22.4 degrees N), India under field conditions in metal cages covered with polyester exclusion filters that specifically cut off UV-B (<320 nm) and UV-A+B (<400 nm) radiation; control plants were grown under ambient solar radiation. Leghemoglobin content was analyzed in the root nodules on the 50(th) day after emergence of seedlings. Exclusion of UV radiations significantly enhanced the leghemoglobin content in the nodules on fresh weight basis; 25% and 45% higher amount of leghemoglobin were present in the nodules after the exclusion of UV-B and UV-A+B radiation respectively. Analysis by native and SDS-PAGE showed high intense bands of leghemoglobin after the exclusion of UV-A+B as compared to control. Exclusion of UV radiation also enhanced the growth of roots as well as aerial parts of the plants. UV Exclusion increased nodulation by increase in the number and size of nodules. The results are discussed in the light of advantage of exclusion for enhancing protein/nitrogen content in the plants.

Considering the environmental threat posed by the biological activity of antibiotics it is quite relevant to assess the resulting impact, especially on sub-lethal endpoints. As such, this study evaluated the effects of ciprofloxacin on Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Lemna minor growth, on the survival and reproduction of Daphnia magna and on Gambusia holbrooki survival. The risks associated with ciprofloxacin effects on non-target organisms were quantified through the calculation of the PEC/PNEC ratio. Overall, the toxicity values obtained (at the mg L-1 level) were higher than the environmental concentrations. P. subcapitata and L. minor were more sensitive under short-term exposures than D. magna and G. holbrooki. No acute toxicity was observed for fish. The chronic assay with D. magna evidenced that long term exposures to lower concentrations of this antibiotic induced impairments on its life-history parameters. Such outcome may pre-empt potential damages on the long-term maintenance of natural populations continuously exposed to the input of antibiotics. Indeed, the PEC/PNEC ratios showed that ciprofloxacin represents a risk for the most sensitive aquatic organisms, since the defined threshold of an acceptable risk was considerably surpassed.

This study was initiated to determine N2 fixation, N and dry matter (DM) accumulation and distribution patterns, and nodulation as influenced by Bradyrhizobium sp. (lupinus) inoculation and N fertilizer. Inoculum strains WU425 and 96B15 were combined in a 1:1 cell ratio in inoculated plots and compared with noninoculated controls at 0, 56, 112, and 168 kg N ha-1 under irrigation on a loamy sand (Udorthentic Haploboroll) in 1989 and 1990. Control plots were maintained nodule-free. Bradyrhizobium strains persisted in this environment, and applied strains nodulated the tap root primarily. Increased total DM and N yield due to inoculation was first observed 42 days after emergence (DAE), and by 84 DAE, was more than twofold that of uninoculated 0-N controls in both years. Dinitrogen fixation, estimated by the difference method, was insignificant before flowering but totalled 157 kg N ha-1 and 196 kg N ha-1 by 84 DAE in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Inoculation or N fertilizer did not influence distribution of dry matter among plant parts. Previously observed enhancement of seed protein concentration due to inoculation was probably due to increased total plant N supply late in the season, not to more efficient mobilization of N to seed in inoculated plants. Supplemental N fertilizer suppressed nodulation and N2 fixation and did not improve early growth. These results indicate that spring-planted white lupine in effective symbiosis with bradyrhizobia are not normally N-limited at any time during growth under most conditions.

Botrytis cinerea differentially induces postharvest antioxidant responses in 'Braeburn' and 'Golden Delicious' apple fruit	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Malus x domestica; postharvest storage; Botrytis cinerea; antioxidant metabolism	L-ASCORBIC-ACID; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; INFECTION; QUANTIFICATION; PEROXIDASE; METABOLISM; FLAVONOIDS; CATALASE; SYSTEMS; STRESS	BACKGROUND The fruit of two apple cultivars - 'Braeburn', which is susceptible to inoculation with Botrytis cinerea, and the less susceptible cv. 'Golden Delicious' - were investigated with respect to their response to inoculation with B. cinerea. Successful infection by B. cinerea leads to an oxidative burst and perturbation of plant redox homeostasis. To investigate the interaction between apple fruit and B. cinerea, antioxidant metabolism in fruit samples from sun-exposed and shaded sides of different tissue types was measured over time. RESULTS The sun-exposed tissue of 'Braeburn' had higher initial levels of total vitamin C in the peel and phenolic compounds in the flesh than 'Golden Delicious', despite its greater susceptibility to gray mold. A substantial antioxidant response was recorded in diseased 'Braeburn' fruit 14 days after inoculation, which involved an elevated superoxide dismutase activity and ascorbate peroxidase activity, a progressive oxidation of total vitamin C, and a decrease in peroxidase activity and phenolic content. Disease development was slower on the sun-exposed sides than on the shaded sides. CONCLUSION The two cultivars appeared to utilize different strategies to defend themselves against B. cinerea. 'Golden Delicious' almost entirely escaped infection. Preharvest exposure of apple fruit to high light / temperature stress appears to prepare them to better resist subsequent postharvest attack and disease. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Nitrogenase and nitrate reductase activities in a soil of low fertility	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article							PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L; FIXATION; CULTIVAR	Foliar application of molybdenum (Mo) at 40 g ha(-1) 25 days after plant emergence greatly enhanced nitrogenase and nitrate reductase activities of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), resulting in an increase in total nitrogen (N) accumulation in shoots. Application of 20 kg N ha(-1) as ammonium sulfate [(NH4)(2)SO4] at sowing decreased nodulation and nitrogenase activity. Rhizobium inoculation did not affect nitrogenase activity which demonstrated that Mo application increased the efficiency of native Rhizobia strains. Nitrogen amendment, either at planting (20 kg N ha(-1)) or as a side dressing (30 kg N ha(-1)) 25 days after plant emergence, did not affect the foliar nitrate reductase activity. Molybdenum foliar spray as ammonium molybdate [(NH4)(6)Mo7O24. 2H(2)O] and N applied as a side dressing increased equally the total amount of N in the pods. A 10% increase in the seed N concentration was obtained with foliar application of Mo, while N applied as a side dressing had no effect on seed N concentration. An average increase of 41% in N export to the seeds was obtained by either Mo or N as side dressing. Nitrogen applied at sowing or Rhizobia inoculation had no effect on the characteristics evaluated 74 days after plant emergence. Plants that received either Mo as foliar spray or as side dressed N had similar yields. This demonstrated that, in certain soils, N fertilization may be replaced by a small amount of Mo as a foliar application.

Where the wild things are: looking for uncultured Glomeromycota	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi; disturbance; Diversisporales; Glomerales; Glomeromycota; host specificity; meta-analysis; virtual taxa	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; GLOBAL DIVERSITY; PLANT-ROOTS; GRASSLAND; COLONIZATION; SYMBIOSIS; SCALE	Our knowledge of Glomeromycotan fungi rests largely on studies of cultured isolates. However, these isolates probably comprise one life-history strategy - ruderal. Consequently, our knowledge of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi may be biased towards fungi that occur primarily in disturbed habitats and associate with disturbance-tolerant host plants. We can expect to see a signal for this in DNA-based community surveys: human-impacted habitats and cultivated plants should yield a higher proportion of AM fungal species that have been cultured compared with natural habitats and wild plants. Using the MaarjAM database (a curated open-access database of Glomeromycotan sequences), we performed a meta-analysis on studies that described AM fungal communities from a variety of habitats and host plants. We found a greater proportion of cultured AM fungal taxa in human-impacted habitats. In particular, undisturbed forests and grasslands/savannahs contained significantly fewer cultured taxa than human-impacted sites. We also found that wild plants hosted fewer cultured fungal taxa than cultivated plants. Our data show that natural communities of AM fungi are composed largely of uncultured taxa, and this is particularly pronounced in natural habitats and wild plants. We are better poised to understand the functioning of AM symbioses associated with cultivated plants and human-impacted habitats.	[Ohsowski, Brian M.; Zaitsoff, P.

However, benefits to fungal symbionts are not well explored, especially in non-mycorrhizal fungi. The Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis proposes that some wood-decomposing fungi may shift life-history strategies to endophytism to bridge gaps in time and space between suitable substrates. To test this hypothesis we examine spatial relationships of Xylaria endophytic fungi in the forest canopy with Xylaria decomposer fungi on the forest floor. We sampled for fungi of the genus Xylaria using a spatially explicit sampling scheme in a remote Ecuadorian cloud forest, and concurrently carried out an extensive culture-based sampling of fungal foliar endophytes. We found 36 species of Xylaria in our 0.5ha plot, 31 of which were found to only occur as fruiting bodies. All five species of Xylaria found as endophytes were also found as fruiting bodies. We also tested the relationships of both stages of these fungi to environmental variables. Decomposer fungi were differentiated by species-specific habitat preferences, with three species being found closer to water than expected by chance. In contrast, endophytes displayed no sensitivity to environmental conditions, such as host, moisture, or canopy cover. We found evidence of spatial linkage between life stages in two species. We also demonstrate that direct transmission of endophytes from leaves to woody substrates is possible. These results indicate that endophytism may represent one way for decomposer fungi to escape moisture limitation, and thatendophytic fungi may act as sources of dispersal for decomposer fungi consistent with predictions of the Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis. Resumen Las simbiosis de plantas con hongos son ubicuas, ancestrales y vitales tanto para funciones ecosistemicas como para la salud de las plantas. Sin embargo, los beneficios a los hongos simbiontes no estan bien explorados, especialmente en hongos no micorrizicos. En este estudio examinamos las relaciones espaciales entre hongos endofitos del genero Xylaria en el dosel con los miembros descomponedores del mismo genero en el suelo, para probar la hipotesis de que algunos hongos poseen estrategias de historia de vida alternas, alternando entre estadios de vida descomponedores y endofitos para aumentar su dispersion y resistir escasez de recursos, conocida como la Hipotesis del Ascomiceto Forrajero. Muestreamos miembros del genero Xylaria usando un muestreo espacial explicito en un bosque de niebla remoto en Ecuador, y llevamos a cabo un muestreo extensivo de hongos endofitos foliares usando cultivos. Encontramos 36 especies de Xylaria en nuestro sitio de 0.5ha. De estas, 31 especies estuvieron presentes solamente como hongos descomponedores. Asimismo, todos los Xylaria endofitos fueron encontrados fueron encontrados como descomponedores. Evaluamos las relaciones entre ambos estadios de estos hongos con variables ambientales. Los hongos descomponedores se diferenciaron por preferencias de habitat especificas para cada especie, pero los endofitos no mostraron sensibilidad a condiciones ambientales, como humedad o cobertura del dosel. Encontramos evidencia de vinculacion espacial entre los estadios de vida en dos especies. En conjunto, nuestros resultados indican que el endofitismo podria representar un medio de escape de los hongos descomponedores a las limitaciones de humedad, y que los hongos endofitos pueden actuar como fuentes de dispersion para los hongos descomponedores, apoyando la Hipotesis del Ascomiceto Forrajero.

The interrelationships between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plants have been the subject of numerous studies; however, whether these mutualistic associations are capable of producing structural defenses in plants for pest control remains to be determined. The present study evaluated the influence of AMF on the sclerification of foliar tissues of corn and related it to insect attack. Corn plants were grown in 5.5-L pots containing soil/sand (sterile, fertilized, pH corrected) in a greenhouse. Mycorrhized plants received propagules of native AMF; non-mycorrhized plants received soil filtrate of AMF-free soil. Some of the plants of both treatments were collected at 40 days post-emergence, while others were collected at 50 days and 60 days. Height and dry mass of the aerial part and dry mass of radicular part were evaluated. The median region of leaves of the fourth (basal) and seventh (cartridge) leaf nodes was transversally sectioned, and the sections stained, mounted in semi-permanent medium and analyzed under a microscope to measure variables related to tissue organization and sclerification. Mycorrhized plants had greater height and aerial-part dry mass. Mycorrhization influenced nine of the 15 anatomical variables analyzed with increased lignified tissue in at least one of the growth stages. It can be concluded that colonization of corn roots by AMF promotes sclerification of leaf tissues and, thus, may interfere indirectly with the plant-pest relationship by altering the quality of phytomass available for insects.

Effect of the Rht-D1 dwarfing locus on Fusarium head blight rating in three segregating populations of winter wheat	PLANT BREEDING			English	Article						Fusarium head blight resistance; Fusarium culmorum; Triticum aestivum; head scab; dwarfing allele Rht-D1b; wild-type allele Rht-D1a; DON; Rht2	QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; PLANT HEIGHT; GENE RHT8; GRAIN-YIELD; RESISTANCE; LINES; BREAD; QTL; ACCUMULATION; DATE	Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the major fungal diseases in wheat throughout the world. To control FHB severity, breeding genetically resistant varieties is thought to be the most promising strategy. In wheat breeding programmes, short cultivars predominantly carrying the Norin 10 derived semi-dwarfing allele Rht-D1b (Rht2) are preferred worldwide because of higher achievable grain yields and lower risk of lodging. This study was conducted to determine the influence of different alleles at the Rht-D1 locus on FHB reaction. Three winter wheat populations were produced by crossing rather susceptible varieties 'Biscay', 'Pirat' and 'Rubens' carrying mutant-type allele Rht-D1b with the more resistant varieties 'Apache', 'Romanus' and 'History' containing the Rht-D1a wild-type allele (rht2). The 190, 216 and 103 progeny of the F-4-derived populations were assayed for the presence of Rht-D1a or Rht-D1b, plant height, and mean FHB rating after spray inoculation at flowering time with a highly aggressive isolate of Fusarium culmorum. Comparably, high mean FHB severities ranging from 28% to 49% for all population x environment combinations were achieved, with significant genotypic variation for FHB rating and plant height within all populations. Both traits were negatively correlated with r ranging from -0.48 to -0.61 in the complete populations. However, within the subpopulations homozygous for one or other height allele these correlations decreased considerably. The Rht-D1b semi-dwarfing allele resulted in 7-18% shorter plants, depending on the population, but a considerably increased FHB reaction of 22-53%. Nevertheless, significant genotypic variance for FHB resistance remained in all tested Rht-D1b subpopulations indicating that selection for moderately FHB resistant genotypes within agronomically beneficial Rht-D1b genotypes is still feasible.

Four-week-old Essoumtem and Clemson spineless seedlings for pot experiment and one-week-old Essoumtem and Clemson spineless seedlings for field experiment were inoculated with fungus,Fusarium oxysporum, and nematode,Meloidogyne incognita. The individual, simultaneous, and sequential inoculation of second stage juveniles (at 1000 J(2)/kg soil) ofMeloidogyne incognitaandFusarium oxysporum(1.1 x 10(6) cells/kg soil) resulted in significant reduced plant growth parameters (plant height, plant girth, chlorophyll content, fresh and dry shoot weights, and fresh and dry root weights). Maximum suppression in plant growth parameters was observed in plants that received NF21 (Fusarium oxysporuminoculated 21 days afterMeloidogyne incognitaon okra) andF21 (fungus inoculated 21 days after seedling emergence) treatments for pot and field experiments, respectively. The least suppression of plant growth parameters was observed in separate inoculations of the two pathogens for both pot and field experiments. Maximum suppression in yield parameters was observed in okra plants that received NF21 andF21 treatments for pot and field experiments, respectively. Minimal yield suppression was observed for individual inoculations (NandFtreatments) in both pot and field experiments. The highest severity of wilt disease was observed on okra plants that received NF21 andF21 treatment in both pot and field experiments. Plants in control plots had higher yields and the least wilt incidences (0.0%).

Nutrient recovery from anaerobic digestion of food waste: impacts of digestate on plant growth and rhizosphere bacterial community composition and potential function in ryegrass	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS			English	Article; Early Access						Soil microbiology; Digestate; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Functional genes; PICRUSt	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; NITROGEN; DIVERSITY; FERTILIZATION; ABUNDANCE; CARBON; DEPOSITION; GRASSLAND; GENES	Global food wastage equates to about 1.3 billion tons per year, which causes serious environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influences of addition of digestate from food waste in comparison to a synthetic liquid urea ammonium nitrate solution on plant growth, rhizosphere bacterial community composition and diversity, and hyphal abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Plant and soil samples were collected at 25, 50, and 75 days after seedling emergence. Annual ryegrass growth was significantly increased by both liquid urea ammonium nitrate and digestate, and digestate was just as effective as liquid urea ammonium nitrate. Additionally, digestate (50 kg N ha(-1)) significantly increased AM fungal hyphae density. Liquid urea ammonium nitrate (50 kg N ha(-1)) significantly decreased AM fungal hyphae density compared with liquid urea ammonium nitrate (25 kg N ha(-1)) at DAE 75. Digestate and liquid urea ammonium nitrate applications significantly shifted the bacterial community composition and OTU richness and changed the abundance of microbial C and N-cycling genes, while application rates had no significant effect. Structural equation modeling showed that digestate and UAN addition both directly and indirectly affected bacterial, C and N cycling genes community composition; the indirect effects were related to increased soil NO(3)(-)content and reduced pH. This study showed that the use of digestate as a soil amendment can be environmentally effective and can provide a sustainable supply of nutrients that increases soil organic C. Moreover, the use of digestate can readily be incorporated into agricultural practices with potentially less impact on soil microflora diversity and function than conventional fertilizers.

Anastomosis behavior differs between asymbiotic and symbiotic hyphae of Rhizophagus clarus	MYCOLOGIA			English	Article						arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; germinating spores; symbiotic mycelia; vegetative compatibility	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; VEGETATIVE INCOMPATIBILITY; DNA; NETWORKS; EXCHANGE; MICROSATELLITES; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; POPULATION; EXPRESSION	The life history of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota) consists of a short asymbiotic phase when spores germinate and a longer symbiotic phase where hyphae forma network within roots and subsequently in the rhizosphere. Hyphal anastomosis contributes to colony formation, yet this process has been studied mostly in the asymbiotic phase rather than in mycorrhizal plants because of methodological limitations. We sought to compare patterns of anastomosis during each phase of fungal growth by measuring hyphal fusions in genetically identical and different single spore isolates of Rhizophagus clarus from different environments and geographic locations. These isolates were genotyped with two anonymous markers of microsatellite-flanking regions. Anastomosis of hyphae from germinating spores was examined in axenic Petri dishes. A rhizohyphatron consisting of agar-coated glass slides bridging single or paired mycorrhizal sorghum plants allowed evaluation of anastomosis of symbiotic hyphae. Anastomosis of hyphae within a colony, defined here as a mycelium from an individual germinating spore or from mycorrhizal roots of one plant, occurred with similar frequencies (8-38%). However, anastomosis between paired colonies was observed in germinating spores from either genetically identical or different isolates, but it was never detected in symbiotic hyphae. The frequency of anastomosis in asymbiotic hyphae from paired interactions was low, occurring in fewer than 6% of hyphal contacts. These data suggest that anastomosis is relatively unconstrained when interactions occur within a colony but is confined to asymbiotic hyphae when interactions occur between paired colonies. This pattern of behavior suggests that asymbiotic and symbiotic phases of mycelium development by R. clarus may differ in function. Anastomosis in the asymbiotic phase may provide brief opportunities for gene flow between populations of this and possibly other AMF species.

Royle and its effects on a fungal pathogen Mycoleptodiscus terrestris (Gerd.) Ostazeski	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL			English	Article						Hydrilla verticillata; Mycoleptodiscus terrestris; biocontrol; aquatic weed; plant nutrition; microsclerotia	NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; FUSARIUM-CULMORUM; DISEASE; EXPRESSION; DISPERSAL; CULTURE; SPORES	The submersed macrophyte, Hydrilla verticillata, was grown using different nutritional regimes under greenhouse conditions to obtain plants that were significantly different in percent nitrogen-free extract, crude fiber, ether-extractable compounds, crude protein, and ash in shoot tissue. Shoots were then challenged by the biological control fungal pathogen, Mycoleptodiscus terrestris, to determine the effects of plant nutritional status on disease severity, growth, and reproduction. Fourteen days post-inoculation, shoots from plants grown in high fertility sediment had significantly greater disease severity ratings than shoots from plants grown in low-fertility sediment. The nutritional status of the plants also impacted asexual reproduction of the pathogen by thin-walled conidia and melanized survival structures called microsclerotia. At 14 days post-inoculation, significantly higher numbers of conidia were produced in flasks containing hydrilla plants grown in high-fertility sediment. In contrast, microsclerotia increased almost fourfold in leaf tissues of hydrilla grown in low-fertility sediment. It appears from these studies that the nutritional condition of target plants cannot be excluded as an important factor in efficacy of pathogens used as biological control agents. The nutritional status of the host tissues influences M. terrestris ingress into host tissues, vegetative growth, production of secondary inoculum in the form of disseminative spores or conidia, and production of survival structures, the microsclerotia.

The oil showed strong antifungal activity based on the inhibition zone and minimal inhibitory concentration values against the pathogen on Petri plates assays. The very low concentrations of them also reduced wet and dry mycelium weight of pathogen fungus in liquid culture. When the oils at 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mu l/mL concentrations were applied to lemon fruits before seven days of pathogen inoculation on storage conditions, the decay on fruits caused by the pathogen could be prevent completely. The results in this study showed that the essential oil of S. hortensis had strong antifungal activity against pathogen fungi tested. So, the essential oil of S. hortensis could be used for management of this pathogen as a potential source of sustainable eco-friendly botanical fungicides. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multilocus phylogeny of Acrospermaceae: New epibiotic species and placement of Gonatophragmium, Pseudovirgaria, and Phaeodactylium anamorphs	MYCOLOGIA			English	Article						Anamorphic; Ascogrammitis; ferns; Mycopteris; neotropical; Pleopeltis; Polypodiaceae; 2 new taxa	NATURAL CLASSIFICATION; RIBOSOMAL DNA; SEQUENCE-DATA; FUNGI; FERNS; IDENTIFICATION; ENDOPHYTES; CHECKLIST; TAXONOMY; PRIMERS	Acrospermum is a poorly known genus of epibiotic and saprophytic species with a subcosmopolitan distribution. Here, we investigate the intriguing relationship between Acrospermum and its host plants in the fern family Polypodiaceae, where it occurs upon approximately 45 neotropical species. We conducted phylogenetic analyses using an eight-marker comprehensive ascomycete data set comprising 719 species representing all major lineages along with 23 new Acrospermum specimens sampled from ferns. We ask whether fern-dwelling Acrospermum are monophyletic, whether epibiotic Acrospermum have evolved independently from saprophytic ancestors, and identify anamorphic phases by incorporating sequences for all suspected taxa. Our results corroborate the placement of Acrospermales within the Dothideomycetes with strong support. However, the order remains incertae sedis due to weak support along the branches subtending the clade that includes the Acrospermales plus Dyfrolomycetales. Our results show a strong phylogenetic pattern in lifestyles but do not clearly identify an ancestral life history state. The first divergence in Acrospermaceae splits fungicolous taxa from taxa that inhabit plants; saprophytes and anamorphic phases found on angiosperms occur in both clades. Fungicolous species are monophyletic, whereas species with an epibiotic or necrotic life history upon plants are nonmonophyletic due to the position of the saprophyte A. longisporium. Previously, all Acrospermum collected from ferns were identified as A. maxonii. Our results indicate that this is not monophyletic due to the inclusion of Gonatophragmium triuniae. Two species are described herein as A. gorditum, sp. nov., and A. leucocephalum, sp. nov. We find no instances of co-cladogenesis; however, our ability to detect this is limited by the lack of resolution in the A. maxonii clade. Rather, we see that that the distribution of epibiotic Acrospermum is explained by the overlap between the ecological niche of the Acrospermum species and its host.

Each protein is highly conserved in eukaryotes, and in the plant lineage has undergone numerous rounds of duplication. Individual NF-Y are emerging as important regulators of several essential plant processes, including embryogenesis, drought resistance, maintenance of meristems in nitrogen-fixing nodules and photoperiod-dependent flowering time. Building on the recent finding that NF-YB2 and NF-YB3 have overlapping functionality in Arabidopsis photoperiod-dependent flowering (Kumimoto et al., 2008), we have identified three NF-YC (NF-YC3, NF-YC4, and NF-YC9) that are also required for flowering, and physically interact in vivo with both NF-YB2 and NF-YB3. Furthermore, NF-YC3, NF-YC4 and NF-YC9 can physically interact with full-length CONSTANS (CO), and are genetically required for CO-mediated floral promotion. Collectively, the present data greatly strengthens and extends the argument that CO utilizes NF-Y transcription factor complexes for the activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) during photoperiod-dependent floral initiation.

The vernal dam hypothesis predicts that spring ephemeral herbs in northern hardwood forests serve as sinks for nutrients during this season and reduce the loss of nutrients from the terrestrial ecosystem. Soil microbes of northern hardwood forests also sequester nutrients during spring. We compared the vernal nutrient acquisition ability of a soilmicrobial community and an understory plant community with species of mixed leaf phenology. We monitored nitrogen and phosphorus pool sizes in understory vegetation and soil microbes during spring from 1999 through 2001 in a northern hardwood forest in the Catskill Mountains, New York. Vegetation nutrient content increased during two spring seasons by an average of 3.07 g N m(-2) and 0.19 g P m(-2) and decreased during one spring by 0.81 g N m(-2) and 0.10 g P m(-2). Evergreen, wintergreen, and deciduous plant species were able to sequester nutrients during spring. Soil microbial nutrient content decreased during one spring by 1.29 g N m(-2) and remained constant during the other two springs. Streamwater nitrogen losses were not correlated with biotic nutrient uptake suggesting a temporal disconnect between the two processes. We conclude that understory vegetation is a larger potential sink for vernal nutrients than are soil microbes in this northern hardwood forest and understory and species representing multiple phenologies are capable of vernal nutrient uptake.

Bioactive coatings from nano-biopolymers/plant extract composites for complete protection from mycotoxigenic fungi in dates	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE			English	Article						antifungal; chitosan edible coating; date decontamination; natural products	POMEGRANATE PEEL EXTRACT; CHITOSAN NANOPARTICLES; QUALITY ENHANCEMENT; ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT; FRUITS; AFLATOXINS	BACKGROUNDContamination of date fruit with mycotoxigenic fungi is a hazardous threat. The present study investigated the effectiveness of natural derivatives for controlling this. Chitosan (Cts) was produced from Aspergillus niger mycelia and characterized and then nanochitosan (NCt) particles were synthesized from fungal Cts. Edible-coating films were formulated based on Cts, NCt, pomegranate peel extract (PPE) and their composites and these were evaluated as antifungal materials against mycotoxigenic fungi, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus ochraceus and Fusarium moniliforme. RESULTSThe Cts produced had 88.7% deacetylation, a molecular weight of 24.5kDa and 98% solubility in diluted acetic acid, whereas the particle diameters of synthesized NCts ranged from 35 to 65nm. The inhibition zone assay emphasized the antifungal effectiveness of the entire coating films. The most effective agent for preparing edible film was the blend of NCt+PPE followed by Cts+PPE based films. The practical application of antifungal films for date decontamination with respect to mycotoxigenic fungi demonstrates that the films were very effective for controlling the entire fungal strain and preventing growth on the fruits. CONCLUSIONThe NCt+PPE and Cts+PPE based films were found to be the most effective because they could completely eliminate the growth of any fungal spore on date fruit after 48h from the coating experiment.

One of the most important plant organs colonized by endophytic microbiota is the seed. The aim of this study was to determine the structure of the seed core microbiome inhabiting the endosperms and embryos of eight wheat cultivars with the use of a culture-independent technique. The seeds ofTriticum aestivumL. cv. Hondia, Wilejka, STH, Opcja, Tybalt, Euforia andTriticum speltaL. cv. Rokosz and Schwabencorn (producer: Plant Breeding Strzelce Sp. z o.o. Group IHAR) were studied. Rokosz and Hondia were cultured in vitro and in vivo to identify obligatory bacterial endophytes. A restrictive analysis of reads originating from the in vitro plants has demonstrated that the bacterial generaPaenibacillusandPropionibacteriuminhabiting Rokosz and Hondia plants have a status of obligatory microorganisms. Greater biodiversity of seed-borne endophytes was found in the seed endosperms than in the embryos. The multiple comparison analysis of the OTU abundance indicated that the seed part significantly influenced the relative abundance. The seed-born microbiome is not statistically significantly dependent on the wheat cultivars; however, it cannot be claimed that every wheat seed is the same.

Winter Wheat Grain Yield Response to Fungicide Application is Influenced by Cultivar and Rainfall	PLANT PATHOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						fungicide; weather; winter wheat; yield response	FUSARIUM HEAD BLIGHT; QUALITY RESPONSE; DISEASE-CONTROL; YELLOW RUST; TEST WEIGHT; DEOXYNIVALENOL; DURATION; SPOT	Winter wheat is susceptible to several fungal pathogens throughout the growing season and foliar fungicide application is one of the strategies used in the management of fungal diseases in winter wheat. However, for fungicides to be profitable, weather conditions conducive to fungal disease development should be present. To determine if winter wheat yield response to fungicide application at the flowering growth stage (Feekes 10.5.1) was related to the growing season precipitation, grain yield from fungicide treated plots was compared to non-treated plots for 19 to 30 hard red winter wheat cultivars planted at 8 site years from 2011 through 2015. At all locations, Prothioconazole + Tebuconazole or Tebuconazole alone was applied at flowering timing for the fungicide treated plots. Grain yield response (difference between treated and non-treated) ranged from 66-696 kg/ha across years and locations. Grain yield response had a positive and significant linear relationship with cumulative rainfall in May through June for the mid and top grain yield ranked cultivars (R-2=54%, 78%, respectively) indicating that a higher amount of accumulated rainfall in this period increased chances of getting a higher yield response from fungicide application. Cultivars treated with a fungicide had slightly higher protein content (up to 0.5%) compared to non-treated. These results indicate that application of fungicides when there is sufficient moisture in May and June may increase chances of profitability from fungicide application.

Variations in the B, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn uptake were studied during soybean development and growth cycle under the influence of biological N-2 fixation and the initial pH of two soils samples (a clayey and a sandy Yellow Latosol; Oxisols), in a greenhouse experiment. These samples were incubated with rates of CaCO3 + MgCO3 (4: 1) to raise the pH (H2O) to 5.2, 5.6, 6.2, and 6.6 in the clay soil and to 5.3, 5.6, 5.9, and 6.3, respectively, in the sandy soil. After 60 days of incubation, the soil samples were fertilized with 450 mg dm(-3) P and 120 mg dm-3 K. Soybean (Glycine max (L) Merrill) seeds of the variety Paranaiba, inoculated with the strains SEMIA 587 and SEMIA 5019 of Bradyrhizobium japonicum were germinated. Four plants per pot (2.2 dm(3)) were grown and harvested 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 46, and 54 days after emergence. The following variables were measured: pH of the rhizosphere (pH(r)), the non-rhizospheric soil pH (between roots) (pH(nr)), the B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn contents in shoots and roots, N in the shoot, number of nodules, and the shoot, root and nodule dry matter. It was observed that changes in pH(r) and pH(nr) depended on the initial soil pH (pH(s)) and on biological N-2 fixation. The accumulation of B and Fe in the shoots was not influenced by the pH(r) values modified depending on the pH, except for Fe in the clay soil. However, nodules appeared 24 days after emergence and nutrient accumulation was significantly increased from then on. For Cu, Mn and Zn uptake seemed to be affected mainly by pH(r). The micronutrient content in the plants proved to be sensitive to changes in the rhizospheric pH, particularly after nodulation.

Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition may be influencing the decline of CSS and replacement by exotic grasses, but the extent to which mycorrhizae are involved in shrubland decline is unknown. NO3- is the dominant form of deposition in southern California, although the native, uneutrophied soils have a greater concentration of NH4+. Seeds of each species were germinated in pots of sterile soil, inoculated with native soil containing mycorrhizal spores and infective root fragments, and fertilized with 50 mug/g of either NO3- or NH4+. NH4+ enhanced the growth of both mycorrhizal species, while NO3- did not. Control plants of B. madritensis under low N had a significant response to mycorrhizae, but A. californica did not. Nitrate increased the growth of nonmycorrhizal A. californica as much as the mycorrhizal NH4+ -treated plants. There is no evidence in this study to suggest that the decline of A. californica or increase in B. madritensis is due to a mycorrhizal response to NO3-, Other life history traits of the two species must be used to explain the invasive behavior of the annual grass. Mycorrhizae may be more important in controlling plant growth in native uneutrophied soils dominated by NH4+ rather than NO3-.

Maize planted in the field was inoculated with Fusarium verticillioides at the filling stage, 15 days after pollination. Two milliliters of spore suspension with a concentration of 5 x 10(6)/ml was injected into the middle of the top ear using pricking ear method to cause maize ear rot. The thirty days after inoculation was the most suitable time for phenotypic evaluation of Fusarium resistance.

We conducted laboratory and glasshouse experiments to test the hypothesis that an unspecialized fungal endophyte (Acremonium strictum) restricted to the root system of the host plant is able to mediate the interaction between a polyphagous herbivorous insect (Helicoverpa armigera) and its host plant (tomatoes, Lycopersicum esculentum). Our studies indicated a significant variation in the ability of inoculated and control plants to support the life history stages of the insect. Larvae reared on inoculated plants suffer significant reduction in growth rate, prolonged development times, suppressed moulting, and produced smaller pupae that were more likely to die, and emerged adults were less fecund compared to larvae reared on control plants. In glasshouse bioassays were larvae were allowed to graze freely, on inoculated plants only 20% survived to the final stadium compared to 54.5% on control plants. No significant differences in the amount of foliage consumed were found between inoculated and control plants, suggesting that A. strictum does not act as a feeding deterrent for H. armigera larvae. Larvae fed inoculated plants showed a significant increase in the relative consumption rate, although the approximate digestibility of ingested food, and efficiency with which both ingested food and digested food was converted to insect biomass decreased during the same period. In addition to reduced efficiency of food utilization, surviving larvae on inoculated plants displayed a significant reduction in relative growth rate. We hypothesized that alterations in phytosterol composition mediated by infection of the fungal endophyte, may explain the reduced larval performance on inoculated plants.

Deciphering interfungal relationships in the 410-million-yr-old Rhynie chert: Morphology and development of vesicle-colonizing microfungi	GEOBIOS			English	Article						Glomeromycotina; Mycoparasitism; Ontogeny; Peronosporomycetes; Reproductive biology; Saprotrophism	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGUS; LAGERSTATTE TIME-SCALE; PB AGE CONSTRAINT; HOT-SPRING SYSTEM; OLD RED SANDSTONE; LAND PLANTS; GIGASPORA-MARGARITA; GLOMEROMYCOTAN SPORES; ENDOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SCOTLAND	The intraradical portion of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi comprises mycelium, vesicles, and special physiological interfaces termed arbuscules; sometimes mycorrhizal fungi also produce spores within their hosts. Arbuscules are ephemeral structures that collapse after a few days, while the hyphae and vesicles appear to remain intact for some time after arbuscule senescence (post-arbuscule stage). However, little is known about the fate of mycorrhizal fungi in the post-arbuscule state. The Lower Devonian Rhynie chert yields the oldest fossil evidence of arbuscular mycorrhizas, including multiple specimens of mycorrhizal axes in the post-arbuscule stage. These fossils indicate that many older vesicles of Rhynie chert mycorrhizal fungi are colonized by other microfungi. Three types of fungal remains in vesicles are distinguished based on morphology and development: (1) spheroidal propagules up to 55 pm in diameter extending from short, distal branches of a hypha; (2) spheroidal propagules up to 23 pm in diameter produced within a tenuous mycelium; and (3) thin-walled propagules up to 10 mu m in diameter within a hyphal inflation. The abundance of microfungal propagules in vesicles of Rhynie chert mycorrhizal fungi suggests that the mycorrhizal vesicles in some way positively affected the development and reproduction of the intrusive microfungi. Although the systematic affinities of the intrusive microfungi remain unresolved, this discovery is important because it broadens our understanding of the levels of organismal interactions that existed in early non-marine ecosystems.

Improved microassays used to test natural product-based and conventional fungicides on plant pathogenic fungi	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article						fungal sensitivity	BOTRYTIS-CINEREA; ANTIFUNGAL; GERMINATION; MANAGEMENT; COMPOUND; DISEASES	Seven important plant pathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, Fusarium oxysporum, Phomopsis obscurans, and P viticola) valuable in screening fungicides were tested. Our procedure included washing conidia to reduce germination times, incorporating Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 as a medium of known composition, and using coverslips in the 24-well cell culture clusters to document the effect of fungicides on fungal morphology. The natural product-based fungicide, sampangine, a sampangine analog, 4-bromosampangine, plus seven conventional fungicides (benomyl, captan, cyprodinil, fenbuconazole, fenhexamid, iprodione, and kresoxim-methyl) were tested in vitro for their ability to inhibit germination and growth of the seven fungal species. Sampangine inhibited germination in all fungi except C acutatum. Comparison of results of germination and morphology microbioassays with results of microtiter assays suggests that some fungicides stop fungal germination, whereas others only slow down fungal growth. We hypothesize that sampangine, except against C acutatum, has the same physical mode of action, germination inhibition, as the conventional fungicides captan, iprodione, and kresoxim-methyl. 4-Bromosampangine caused morphological anomalies including excessive branching of germ tubes of C. fragariae and splaying and branching of germ tubes of B. cinerea.

It is often infected with mutualistic fungal endophytes that confer protection to the plant against biotic and abiotic stresses. Bioassays that test their antibiotic effect on invertebrates are varied and range from excised leaves to whole plants. The aim of this study was to design and validate a high-throughput in-planta bioassay using 7-day-old seedlings confined in small cups, allowing for rapid assessments of aphid life history to be made while maintaining high replication and treatment numbers. Antibiosis was evaluated on the foliar and the root aphid species; Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) and Aploneura lentisci (Passerini) feeding on a range of perennial ryegrass-Epichloe festucae var. Lolii endophyte symbiota. As expected, both D. noxia and A. lentisci reared on endophyte-infected plants showed negatively affected life history traits by comparison to non-infected plants. Both species exhibited the highest mortality at the nymphal stage with an average total mortality across all endophyte treatments of 91% and 89% for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively. Fecundity decreased significantly on all endophyte treatments with an average total reduction of 18% and 16% for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively by comparison to non-infected plants. Overall, the bioassay proved to be a rapid method of evaluating the insecticidal activity of perennial ryegrass-endophyte symbiota on aphids (nymph mortality could be assessed in as little as 24 and 48 hours for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively). This rapid and simple approach can be used to benchmark novel grass-endophyte symbiota on a range of aphid species that feed on leaves of plants, however we would caution that it may not be suitable for the assessment of root-feeding aphids, as this species exhibited relatively high mortality on the control as well.

The objective of this study was to verify the diversity of diazotrophic bacteria that nodulate cowpea in soils of the lower half of the Sao Francisco River Valley by morphological and genotypic characterization. Seven soil samples (A1, A2, A3, A4, C1, C2 and MC) were collected to capture bacteria associated to five cowpea cultivars (IPA 206, BRS Pujante, BRS Marataoa, Canapu Roxo, and Sempre Verde), in a 5x7 factorial design with three replications. Thirty days after plant emergence, the nodules were collected and the bacteria isolated and analyzed in relation to their growth characteristics in YMA medium. The 581 isolates were grouped in 49 morphologic groups. Of this total, 62.3 % formed colonies in up to three days, 33.4 % grew from the 6(th) day on, and 4.3 % began to grow 4 to 5 days after incubation. Regarding the formation of acids and alkalis, 63 % acidified the medium, 12 % made it alkaline and 25 % maintained the medium at neutral pH. The highest diversity was observed in the A3 sample and in isolates associated with the cultivars Canapu Roxo and BRS Pujante. Thirty-eight representative isolates were chosen for the genotypic characterization, clustered in four groups based on the restriction analysis of 16s rDNA. This grouping was strongly correlated with the sampling site; 13 rhizobium isolates had an electrophoretic profile distinct from the standard rhizobium strains used in this study.

Yet, during most of their ontogeny, fruit remain chemically defended and effectively suppress herbivores and pathogens by high levels of secondary metabolites. Olive flies (Bactrocera oleae) are uniquely able to develop in unripe olives. Unlike other frugivorous tephritids, the larvae maintain bacteria confined within their midgut caeca. We examined the interaction between larvae, their associated bacteria, and fruit chemical defence, hypothesizing that bacterial contribution to larval development is contingent on the phenology of fruit defensive chemistry. We demonstrate that larvae require their natural complement of bacteria (Candidatus Erwinia dacicola: Enterobacteriaceae) in order to develop in unripe olives. Conversely, when feeding on ripe fruit, larval development proceeds independently of these bacteria. Our experiments suggest that bacteria counteract the inhibitory effect of oleuropein-the principal phenolic glycoside in unripe olives. In light of these results, we suggest that the unique symbiosis in olive flies, compared with other frugivorous tephritids, is understood by considering the relationship between the fly, bacteria and fruit chemistry. When applied in an evolutionary context, this approach may also point out the forces which shaped symbioses across the Tephritidae.

Tomato seedlings were transplanted 15 days after germination into pots inoculated with 4000 M. incognita eggs obtained from a pure population maintained on tomato plants (cv. Santa Clara). In the first experiment, three days after inoculation the plants were sprayed with fish waste; a commercial preparation, at concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mL/L of water. Applications were repeated every week or fortnight until evaluation. In the second experiment, treatments of castor bean cake, bone meal and bokashi were applied in the soil at a rate of 20 g/pot and fish waste was sprayed at a concentration of 2 mL/L of water, three days after inoculation. Sixty days after inoculation, the plants were evaluated in terms of height, fresh and dry shoot weights, fresh root weight and number of galls, eggs/root system and eggs/g of root. Fish waste and bone meal were not efficient in controlling the nematode. Both bokashi and castor bean cake significantly reduced nematode reproduction, but only bokashi improved plant growth.

It may be used as well to move vegetation from the field for experimentation under controlled conditions. Transplantation has not in the past been considered a reliable means of conserving threatened species or reproducing functional characteristics of natural communities, and has been regarded by many as highly ineffective. However, its potential must now be re-examined because of the many recent transplant attempts as well as advances in related fields. Recent trials illustrate that individual endangered species are still particularly difficult to transplant and displaced multi-species sods are almost always changed in the process. Exact reconstruction of communities from individual components is next to impossible because the full complement of species, including critical microbial components, is almost never known. Owing to a limited understanding of phenology, reproduction, functional roles, and interrelationships among constituent microbes, cryptogams, vascular plants, and fauna, transplants may be placed into sites with both biological and physical insufficiencies. Genetic diversity may be lost or, if genotypes from diverse sources are mixed, outbreeding depression may result. Recent advances in soil science, microbial ecology, and population genetics have in some cases improved the effectiveness of transplantation, but new insights mainly permit a fuller appreciation of the causes of failure. Home-site advantage has been demonstrated, and habitat protection appears to be the best and perhaps only reliable way of preserving intact natural communities and rare species. Furthermore, experimentation with vegetational mats under controlled conditions may have little relevance to natural ecosystems.

The objective was to evaluate the response of strains of snap beans to parasitism of Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica. Five strains were evaluated with and without inoculation, and as a witness to the viability of inoculum were used tomato plants cv. 'Santa Cruz', in a green house. The inoculum of nematodes was obtained by multiplication in tomato plants grown for 60 days. We used plastic pots for 3L substrate compound sand and soil in 2: 1 ratio, 20 days after emergence the seedlings were inoculated with 5000 eggs and juvenile nematodes per pot. The experimental design was randomized, distributed in five treatments (lineage) for each nematode species, with 10 repetitions. At the end of the cycle plants were evaluated for development and reproduction of nematodes. None of the strains showed immunity to nematodes (FR = 0), but the strains HAB 402, 408, 411, and 428 were resistant with FR < 1, and HAB strain 403 behaved as susceptible to the two species of nematodes studied, FR = 1.117 for M. javanica and FR = 6.006 for M. incognita.

We investigated the effect of carbon (C) addition, aimed at reducing soil nutrient availability, on arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization. Seedlings of 27 plant species with different sets of life-history traits (functional group affiliation, life history strategy and nitrophilic status) were grown in pots filled with soil from a nutrient-rich set-aside field and amended with different amounts of C. Mycorrhizal colonization was progressively reduced along the gradient of increasing C addition in 17 out of 27 species, but not in the remaining species. Grasses had lower colonization levels than forbs and legumes and the decline in AM fungal colonization was more pronounced in legumes than in other forbs and grasses. Mycorrhizal colonization did not differ between annual and perennial species, but decreased more rapidly along the gradient of increasing C addition in plants with high Ellenberg N values than in plants with low Ellenberg N values. Soil C addition not only limits plant growth through a reduction in available nutrients, but also reduces mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots. The effect of C addition on mycorrhizal colonization varies among plant functional groups, with legumes experiencing an overproportional reduction in AM fungal colonization along the gradient of increasing C addition. We therefore propose that for a better understanding of vegetation succession on set-aside fields one may consider the interrelationship between plant growth, soil nutrient availability and mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots.

Resistance inducers activate enzymes involved in defense mechanisms and micronutrients can influence this process by acting as enzymatic cofactors. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of foliar application of a commercial organomineral fertilizer and its association or not with zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) micronutrients on the Pratylenchus brachyurus suppression and soybean plant development under greenhouse conditions. Shoots of soybean were treated 10 days after germination and inoculated with 5000 nematodes/plant five days after the treatments, using untreated plants as controls. Treatments consisted of a commercial product based on phosphorylated mannanoligosaccharide derived from the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (here coded as MOS), Zn, Mn, MOS+Zn, MOS+Mn or MOS+Zn+Mn. At sixty days after establishment of treatments, the plants were collected and evaluated for vegetative analysis, nematological analysis and nutrient contents. The work was repeated at different times: experiment 1 from November 2016 to January 2017 and experiment 2 from October to November 2017. All treatments were efficient in controlling P. brachyurus in at least one of the evaluated nematological parameters, compared to the control. However, only the plant spraying with MOS+Zn results in significative reduction of the total number of nematodes and the number of P. brachyurus nematodes per gram of soybean root in both experiments. In addition, spraying of plants with Mn increased shoot dry weight and all treatments resulted in higher concentrations of copper, Zn and Mn in soybeans leaves compared to control.

Marked differences (P < 0.05; P < 0.01) were recorded for spread of vegetative growth past the edge of the plot (63-137 cm), nodulation (71-165 nodules/plant; 7.8-14.8 g/plant DM), time to 50% flowering (45-93 days), forage production (2.7-4.3 t/ha) and seed yield (141-691 kg/ha). Differences in nutritive value of dry matter were recorded for K (1.3-3.2%) and Ca (0.9-1.6%) concentrations but not for N (2.4-3.1%) and P (0.05-0.07%) concentrations, fibre nitrogen (0.5-0.9%) and forage digestibility (65-69%). Accessions B052C, B108 and B366 were the most promising as sources of fodder. They consistently produced high yields of good quality fodder and ample amounts of seed. The mineral concentrations and forage digestibility could support cattle requirements for medium to high levels of ruminant animal production with the exception of the P levels. The low P levels were also compounded by high Ca concentrations.

Postharvest oranges frequently deteriorate due to green mould (Penicillium digitatum), which causes significant losses. The aims of this study were to determine the composition and diversity of yeasts on plants of the Brazilian Cerrado and to explore their potential for inhibiting citrus green mould. Leaves and fruit of Byrsonima crassifolia and Eugenia dysenterica were collected from Cerrado conservation areas, and thirty-five yeasts were isolated and identified by sequencing the D1-D2 domain of the rDNA large subunit (26S). The isolates represented the Aureobasidium, Meyerozyrna, Candida, and Pichia genera. Three isolates identified as Aureobasidium pullulans exhibited potential for the control of P. digitatum in both in vitro and in vivo tests; these isolates reduced the incidence of disease and increased the storage time of fruit. Aureobasidium. pullulans has immense potential for the biological control of filamentous fungi. (C) 2015 The British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Milk from two farms (A, extensive; B, intensive) was processed in traditional and standard conditions. Chemical and physical traits of cheeses were affected by the farming system and the cheese making technology, and changed during ripening. Content in NaCl and N soluble was lower, and paste consistency higher in cheese from the extensive farm and traditional technology, whereas ripening increased the N soluble and the paste yellow and consistency. The ripening time decreased the number of all lactic acid bacteria (LAB) groups, except enterococci detected at approximately constant levels (10(4) and 10(5) cfu g(-1) for standard and traditional cheeses, respectively), till 120 d of ripening. In all productions, at each ripening time, the levels detected for enterococci were lower than those for the other LAB groups. The canonical discriminant analysis of chemical, physical and microbiological data was able to separate cheeses from different productions and ripening time. The dominant LAB were isolated, phenotypically characterised and grouped, genetically differentiated at strain level and identified. Ten species of LAB were found and the strains detected at the highest levels were Pediococcus acidilactici and Lactobacillus casei. Ten strains, mainly belonging to Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus fermentum showed an antibacterial activity. The comparison of the polymorphic profiles of the LAB strains isolated from the wooden vat with those of the strains collected during maturation, showed the persistence of three enterococci in traditional cheeses, with Enterococcus faecalis found at dominant levels over the Enterococcus population till 120 d; the absence of these strains in the standard productions evidenced the contribution of vat LAB during Caciocavallo Palermitano cheese ripening.

However, from results published to date, it is unclear whether the increase in productivity and plant diversity obtained with increased AMF richness is a consequence of higher richness in itself or whether it is caused simply by an uncontrolled, higher mycorrhizal potential in the more diverse AMF inocula used. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effect of AMF richness on the biomass and survival of several wild plant species from La Gran Sabana, Venezuela, comparing AMF inocula of varying richness but with similar mycorrhizal potential. We studied the effect of two inocula (containing two and five AMF species respectively, each with 600 propagules/100 g of soil) on growth and survival in a community composed of three woody species indigenous to La Gran Sabana. No differences were found in dry mass production or plant survival when the two inocula of contrasting richness were compared. Reasons for such results include the life history strategies of the AMF used in the present work.

An assay was conducted in Elisa plates, with the addition of 200 mu L of the streptomycete metabolites, along with 20 mu L of suspension containing 25 second stage juveniles (J2) of M incognita. The metabolites produced by Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus caused mortality of 98.2% on M incognita. A second assay was conducted with 3 mL of streptomycete metabolites and 25 eggs of M incognita. The isolate N0035 of Streptomyces caused inhibition of 98.8% on hatching. In a third assay, potting mix was infested with suspension of the streptomycetes isolates and incubated for 30 days. Fifteen days after germination, tomato seedlings were inoculated with a suspension containing 2,000 J2 of M incognita. Reductions of 68% in the number of galls per gram of roots and of 76.8% in the egg mass per gram of roots were observed on tomato seedlings grown in the potting mix inoculated with Streptomyces griseus subsp. griseus, compared to the control.

The opening of Pandora's Box: climate change impacts on soil fertility and crop nutrition in developing countries	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Drought; Erosion; Food security; Precipitation; Soil degradation; Soil organic carbon; Temperature	TRITICUM-AESTIVUM L.; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; NITROGEN-FIXATION; FOOD SECURITY; ORGANIC-CARBON; WINTER-WHEAT; WATER-USE; PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA	Feeding the world's growing population is a serious challenge. Food insecurity is concentrated in developing nations, where drought and low soil fertility are primary constraints to food production. Many crops in developing countries are supported by weathered soils in which nutrient deficiencies and ion toxicities are common. Many systems have declining soil fertility due to inadequate use of fertility inputs, ongoing soil degradation, and increasingly intense resource use by burgeoning populations. Climate models predict that warmer temperatures and increases in the frequency and duration of drought during the 21st century will have net negative effects on agricultural productivity. The potential effects of climate change on soil fertility and the ability of crops to acquire and utilize soil nutrients is poorly understood, but is essential for understanding the future of global agriculture. This paper explores how rising temperature, drought and more intense precipitation events projected in climate change scenarios for the 21st century might affect soil fertility and the mineral nutrition of crops in developing countries. The effects of climate change on erosion rates, soil organic carbon losses, soil moisture, root growth and function, root-microbe associations and plant phenology as they relate to mineral nutrition are discussed. Our analysis suggests that the negative impacts of climate change on soil fertility and mineral nutrition of crops will far exceed beneficial effects, which would intensify food insecurity, particularly in developing countries.

It was discovered that in the case of yeasts and mold fungi the type of applied mixture affects the growth dynamics in the ripening silages. The ensiling agents used in the process inhibited the development of these microorganisms, but did not inhibit the normal course of lactic acid fermentation taking place in the ensiled plant material. It was discovered that preservatives B and D considerably inhibited the development of mold fungi in all the experimental combinations and all the analysis dates. These additives affected the inhibition of yeasts growth to a lesser degree. The weakest action towards fungi was observed for preservative C.

Parasitoids were allowed to parasitize 2nd and 3rd instar L. huidobrensis larvae reared on endophytically-inoculated faba bean, Vicia faba. In the control, parasitoids were reared on non-inoculated host plants. Parasitism, pupation, adult emergence and survival were recorded. No significant difference was observed between the control and the endophyte-inoculated plants in terms of parasitism rates of P. scabriventris (p = 0.68) and D. isaea (p = 0.45) and adult' survival times (p = 0.06). The survival period of the F1 progeny of P. scabriventris was reduced (p<0.0001) in B. bassiana S4SU1 to 28 days as compared to more than 40 days for B. bassiana G1LU3, ICIPE 279 and H. lixii F3ST1. However, no significant difference (p = 0.54) was observed in the survival times of the F1 progeny of D. isaea. This study has demonstrated that together, endophytes and parasitoids have beneficial effects in L. huidobrensis population suppression.	[Akutse, Komivi S.; Fiaboe, Komi K.

The present study reports the results of gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analyses of the essential oils from the aerial parts of Ballota nigra L. ssp foetida (Lamiaceae) collected at flowering and fruiting times, as well as their in vitro antifungal activity against nine plant pathogenic fungi. Moreover, the essential oils were evaluated for their antifungal activity using the agar dilution method, and also MIC, (minimum inhibitory concentrations) and MFCs (minimum fungicidal concentrations) were determined. The major compounds identified in the flowering and fruiting aerial parts oils respectively were beta-caryophyllene (22.6% and 21.8%), caryophyllene oxide (18.0% and 20.5%) and germacrene-D (16.5 and 13.1%). The oils showed in vitro antifungal activity against some species of Fusarium, Botrytis cinerea, and Alternaria solani. Our study indicates that the oil of B. nigra ssp foetida could be used as a control agent for plant pathogenic fungi in natural formulations.

A high frequency of shoot regeneration was achieved from stem explants of N. strumosa genotype White Cultured on MS medium containing 0.75 mg l(-1) thidiazuron (TDZ) and 0.1 mg l(-1) NAA. Stable transformants were obtained by combining this regeneration procedure with inoculation of the stem segments with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV2260 harboring the binary vector pBIGFP121, which contains the NPTII gene as a selectable marker and the GFP (green fluorescent protein) gene as a visual marker. Adventitious shoots appeared on the stem segments 4-6 weeks after Agrobacterium inoculation. Putative transformants were identified using kanamycin selection and examination of the shoots with a fluorescence microscope. PCR and Southern blot analysis confirmed integration of the GFP gene into the genomes of the transformant. The transformation efficiency of this technique reached 9% of inoculated explants. Rooted transformants were transferred to soil and began to flower within 35 days after potting, 4 months after Agrobacterium inoculation. The transformants were morphologically normal and no polyploid individuals were observed. The success of this protocol makes it highly useful for producing transgenic Nemesia plants.

However, little is known about how fire may indirectly impact shrub performance by altering mycorrhizal symbionts. We used molecular tools, including ARISA and fungal ITS sequencing, to characterize the mycorrhizal communities on resprouting Betula nana shrubs across a fire-severity gradient after the largest tundra fire recorded in the Alaskan Arctic (July-October 2007). Fire effects on the components of fungal composition were dependant on the scale of taxonomic resolution. Variation in fungal community composition was correlated with fire severity. Fungal richness and relative abundance of dominant taxa declined with increased fire severity. Yet, in contrast to temperate and boreal regions with frequent wildfires, mycorrhizal fungi on resprouting shrubs in tundra were not strongly differentiated into fire-specialists and fire-sensitive fungi. Instead, dominant fungi, including taxa characteristic of late successional stages, were present regardless of fire severity. It is likely that the resprouting life history strategy of tundra shrubs confers resilience of dominant mycorrhizal fungi to fire disturbance by maintaining an inoculum source on the landscape after fire. Based on these results, we suggest that resprouting shrubs may facilitate post-fire vegetation regeneration and potentially the expansion of trees and shrubs under predicted scenarios of increased warming and fire disturbance in Arctic tundra.

Two Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch) Sorokin strains, V275 and ERL700, were the most effective, causing 85-96% mortality of thrips larvae and pupae (as measured by relative adult emergence rates), 11 days after inoculation. Mortality in other M. anisopliae-treated media ranged from 51-84%; Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin strains caused 54-84% mortality, and Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Wize) 63-75% mortality. In contrast, mortality from the insecticide treatment (fipronil 1 g l(-1) medium) was only 15-54%. Metarhizium anisopliae V275 was selected for more in-depth evaluation under greenhouse conditions. There was no significant difference in M. anisopliae efficacy in growing media whether it was applied as drench (84-93%) or premixed into the medium as dry conidia (85-92%). The use of M. anisopliae with reduced rates of either fipronil or imidacloprid did not significantly improve control. Overall, our study shows that M. anisopliae V275 is robust and offers much promise for the control of soil-dwelling stages of thrips as part of an integrated pest-management programme.	[Ansari, M.

Penetration and development ofPratylenchus brachyurusin maize roots treated with acibenzolar-S-methyl	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Alternative control; Resistance induction; Root lesions nematodes; Zea mays	ROTYLENCHULUS-RENIFORMIS; PRATYLENCHUS-BRACHYURUS; MELOIDOGYNE-INCOGNITA; RESISTANCE INDUCERS; POLYPHENOL OXIDASE; INFECTION; SPP.; PEROXIDASE; NEMATODES; JAVANICA	The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) in the penetration, development, and multiplication ofP. brachyurusin maize. For this, maize seedlings cv. AL Bandeirantes, after 10 days of germination, were inoculated with 800 nematodes. Part of the plants were treated with ASM sprayed at the dose 0.25 g a.i. L-1, while another part were inoculated but not treated. Every five (experiment 1) and two (experiment 2) days after treatment (DAT), the plants were removed, the roots washed and stained with acid fuchsin for counting nematodes. The nematodes were also quantified at 30 and 60 DAT, and their length measured using an eyepiece graticule coupled to the optical microscope, in which the nematodes were classified in three groups: 0.10 to 0.29, 0.30 to 0.49 and 0.50 to 0.69 mm. ASM reduced the final nematode population in maize roots at 30 and 60 DAT, and the number of juveniles, adults and eggs in the plant root system at 8 and 10 DAT. In relation to the nematode development, an increase in the proportion of nematodes at an early stage (0.10 to 0.29 mm) and a lower proportion of nematodes presenting between 0.50 and 0.65 mm of length were observed in plants treated with ASM compared to control. Therefore, results suggest that the product studied may affect the development and reproduction of the nematode.	[Puerari, H.

During 1998-2000, the viruses detected were: Turnip mosaic virus (genus Potyvirus) (TuMV), Turnip yellow mosaic virus (genus Tymovirus) (TYMV), Turnip crinkle virus (genus Carmovirus) (TCV), Turnip rosette virus (genus Sobemovirus) (TRoV), Beet western yellows virus (genus Polerovirus) (BWYV) and Cauliflower mosaic virus (genus Caulimovirus) (CaMV). Multiple infections were detected in some individuals (48/447). TuMV was detected infrequently over the three-year period (5/597). A representative isolate of each virus was tested for its effects on glasshouse-grown individuals from different half-sib families of B. nigra from four of the sites. Whether inoculated manually or via aphids (Myzus persicae), TuMV caused a rapid (within 10 days) lethal systemic necrosis in the B. nigra seedlings except when they were near flowering at the time of inoculation. Each of the other viruses invaded systemically but were not lethal. Indeed, BWYV systemically invaded 13/19 glasshouse-grown B. nigra seedlings but did not produce any visible symptoms. Otherwise, the isolates tested differed in their pathogenicity and in the symptoms they produced in infected B. nigra. With TYMV or TCV viral antigen concentration was closely linked to pathogenicity; for TRoV or CaMV, there was little or no difference in virus concentration between plants with and without symptoms. Substantial and reproducible differences were observed in sensitivity/susceptibility among B. nigra genotypes from different sites in Dorset challenged with the same virus isolate.

Identification of biotic/abiotic factors that determine crop responses to AM fungal inoculation is an essential step for successful application of the fungi in sustainable agriculture. We conducted three field trials on soybean with a commercial inoculum and developed a new molecular tool to dissect interactions between the inoculum and indigenous fungi on the MiSeq sequencing platform. Regression analysis indicated that sequence read abundance of the inoculum fungus was the most significant factor that determined soybean yield responses to the inoculation, suggesting that dominance of the inoculum fungus is a necessary condition for positive yield responses. Agricultural practices (fallow/cropping in the previous year) greatly affected the colonization levels (i.e. read abundances) of the inoculum fungus via altering the propagule density of indigenous AM fungi. Analysis of niche competition revealed that the inoculum fungus competed mainly with the indigenous fungi that are commonly distributed in the trial sites, probably because their life-history strategy is the same as that of the inoculum fungus. In conclusion, we provide a new framework for evaluating the significance of environmental factors towards successful application of AM fungi in agriculture.

Soil salinization is a major soil degradation threat worldwide. Sparse vegetation and soil desertification are widespread phenomena in coastal saline land due to high salt content in soil, poor soil structure and freshwater shortages. In recent years, a method of vegetation reconstruction using water-salt regulation by drip-irrigation technology combined with agronomic engineering has been developed and successfully applied in coastal regions around Bohai Gulf, China. This study aimed to investigate the effect of this reconstruction method on soil properties and vegetation during reclamation periods of 0-3 years. The results showed that soil salinity and sodium adsorption ratios decreased with time that significantly reduced in the first year and gradually became stable after that, especially at shallow soil depths. Soil microbial numbers especially bacteria significantly increased and followed a linear relationship with time. Weeds eventually germinated naturally in soils; thus, vegetation coverage and species number significantly increased from initial values of 1.67% and 1 to 82.67% and 15, respectively. These findings showed that a good soil and plant ecosystem was established after reclamation and offered insight into ecosystem restoration and construction in coastal saline land.

Ten cucurbit PIs with known partial resistance to Phytophthora capsici root and crown rot were evaluated for resistance to Phytophthora fruit rot. Unwounded fruit from field-grown plants of Cucurbita moschata and C. pepo were inoculated in a controlled environment at 7 to 10 or 21 to 24 days post-pollination (dpp) with virulent P. capsici isolates to examine the effect of fruit age on disease development. Inoculated fruit were rated for lesion area and pathogen mycelial growth 7 days post-inoculation (dpi); fruit length, diameter, and pericarp thickness were also rated. Two C. pepo accessions (PI 169417 and PI 181761) had significant resistance to Phytophthora fruit rot at both 7 to 10 dpp and 21 to 24 dpp. All accessions evaluated displayed reduced disease susceptibility as the fruit aged.

However, plants may have defense strategies that reduce Cu and Zn availability in rhizosphere soil. The study aimed to evaluate growth of white oats (Avena sativa) and Cu and Zn availability in rhizosphere soil subjected to long-term applications of pig slurry (PS) and pig deep litter (PL). The study was carried out with samples of a Typic Hapludalf soil from an 11-year experiment with annual fertilization of 180 kg N ha(-1) as pig slurry (PS180) and pig deep litter (PL180) and a control (C) treatment. White oats were grown in pots with soil collected at 0.0-0.10 m depth. Thirty-five and 70 days after emergence (DAE), rhizosphere (RS) and bulk soil (BS) were analyzed to determine Cu and Zn availability. Plant growth, tissue Cu and Zn concentration, and content (concentration X dry weight) were measured. The application of pig manure for 11 years increased available soil Cu and Zn, as well as tissue concentration and content. Dry matter yield and plant height in PL180 were similar to those found in plants grown in the control treatment, while plants grown in PS180 had higher dry matter than in C. We found few differences in soil chemical characteristics and Cu and Zn contents between RS and BS. The high Cu concentrations in roots, especially in soil treated with PL180, show that Cu retention in the roots prevents excess Cu transport to white oat shoots.

Characters at any of these levels can be ordered into hierarchical patterns defining taxonomic groups if they are conserved enough to be heritable through geologic time in all descendants of a common ancestor. At present, only morphological characters associated with mode of spore formation and in subcellular structure of spores are sufficiently stable and diverse to recognize at least 150 species. Ontogenetic comparisons indicate that species integrity, despite asexual reproduction, is the result of rigid internal constraints imposed on variation during the process of spore subcellular differentiation. Epigenetic factors dominate because the differentiation sequence is linear and each new stage is causally linked to preceding stages. Some morphological characters of the fungal mycelium also exist, but they define more inclusive groups at the family level and above. Most diversity in the mycorrhizae consists of life-history traits associated with abundance and architecture of fungal components, their rate of formation and longevity, and their cost in the symbiosis. These characters participate in processes at the molecular and ecological levels, so they are autonomous from morphological determinants. They often are labile or affected by external environmental conditions, so fewer stable taxonomic characters are likely to be discovered. Instead, molecular and ecological diversity has greater potential to define; (a) niche specificity of organisms/populations and (b) causal processes linked to host-fungus compatibility and mycorrhizal efficiency. Any taxonomic characters that relate to mycorrhizal functions will come only from comparative studies involving organisms from shared habitats rather than those having shared spore morphologies.

A field and laboratory study of urediniospore viability was conducted to determine the potential of using infected plant material for redistribution of inoculum into new areas. To better understand the life history of P. j. solstitialis, urediniospore viability was measured during the summer and fall when the host plant is usually senescent. Latent period (time from inoculation to pustule eruption) after field and laboratory inoculations was measured in order to determine the potential number of urediniospore generations that occur per year. Viability of urediniospores stored in the laboratory gradually declined over a period of 10 weeks, spore hydration increased germination. Based on the results obtained in this study, introductions of harvested infected plant material would have to be done quickly to offset losses in urediniospore viability. Urediniospore viability in the field decreased exponentially 86% near the coast and 97% in the Central Valley three weeks after production, and was negligible (0-0.2%) thereafter. Latent period ranged from four to five weeks at cool winter temperatures to two to three weeks at warm summer temperatures in both the laboratory and field. Results of this study suggest that urediniospores are not likely to remain viable through the summer and fall dry season.

Distinctive Bacterial Communities in the Rhizoplane of Four Tropical Tree Species	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article							GRADIENT GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; SP-NOV.; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; RHIZOSPHERE SOIL; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS; LOLIUM-PERENNE; GRASS-ROOTS; PLANT; DIVERSITY	It is known that the microbial community of the rhizosphere is not only influenced by factors such as root exudates, phenology, and nutrient uptake but also by the plant species. However, studies of bacterial communities associated with tropical rainforest tree root surfaces, or rhizoplane, are lacking. Here, we analyzed the bacterial community of root surfaces of four species of native trees, Agathis borneensis, Dipterocarpus kerrii, Dyera costulata, and Gnetum gnemon, and nearby bulk soils, in a rainforest arboretum in Malaysia, using 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The rhizoplane bacterial communities for each of the four tree species sampled clustered separately from one another on an ordination, suggesting that these assemblages are linked to chemical and biological characteristics of the host or possibly to the mycorrhizal fungi present. Bacterial communities of the rhizoplane had various similarities to surrounding bulk soils. Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Betaproteobacteria were dominant in rhizoplane communities and in bulk soils from the same depth (0-10 cm). In contrast, the relative abundance of certain bacterial lineages on the rhizoplane was different from that in bulk soils: Bacteroidetes and Betaproteobacteria, which are known as copiotrophs, were much more abundant in the rhizoplane in comparison to bulk soil. At the genus level, Burkholderia, Acidobacterium, Dyella, and Edaphobacter were more abundant in the rhizoplane. Burkholderia, which are known as both pathogens and mutualists of plants, were especially abundant on the rhizoplane of all tree species sampled. The Burkholderia species present included known mutualists of tropical crops and also known N fixers. The host-specific character of tropical tree rhizoplane bacterial communities may have implications for understanding nutrient cycling, recruitment, and structuring of tree species diversity in tropical forests. Such understanding may prove to be useful in both tropical forestry and conservation.

Light sensing by opsins and fungal ecology: NOP-1 modulates entry into sexual reproduction in response to environmental cues	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						asexual-sexual switch; ecology; fungi; light response; oxidative stress	FRUITING BODY DEVELOPMENT; NEUROSPORA-CRASSA; GENE-EXPRESSION; FUNCTIONAL DIVERGENCE; NADPH OXIDASES; BLUE-LIGHT; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; PHYTOCHROME FPHA; BOTRYTIS-CINEREA; WHITE-COLLAR	Understanding the genetic basis of the switch from asexual to sexual lifestyles in response to sometimes rapid environmental changes is one of the major challenges in fungal ecology. Light appears to play a critical role in the asexual-sexual switch-but fungal genomes harbour diverse light sensors. Fungal opsins are homologous to bacterial green-light-sensory rhodopsins, and their organismal functions in fungi have not been well understood. Three of these opsin-like proteins were widely distributed across fungal genomes, but homologs of the Fusarium opsin-like protein CarO were present only in plant-associated fungi. Key amino acids, including potential retinal binding sites, functionally diverged on the phylogeny of opsins. This diversification of opsin-like proteins could be correlated with life history-associated differences among fungi in their expression and function during morphological development. In Neurospora crassa and related species, knockout of the opsin NOP-1 led to a phenotype in the regulation of the asexual-sexual switch, modulating response to both light and oxygen conditions. Sexual development commenced early in Delta nop-1 strains cultured in unsealed plates under constant blue and white light. Furthermore, comparative transcriptomics showed that the expression of nop-1 is light-dependent and that the Delta nop-1 strain abundantly expresses genes involved in oxidative stress response, genes enriched in NAD/NADP binding sites, genes with functions in proton transmembrane movement and catalase activity, and genes involved in the homeostasis of protons. Based on these observations, we contend that light and oxidative stress regulate the switch via light-responsive and ROS pathways in model fungus N.crassa and other fungi.

Half of the plants were inoculated with Funneliformis mosseae arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the other half served as non-infected controls. Root electrical capacitance and daily transpiration were monitored during the whole plant ontogeny. Phenology-dependent changes of daily transpiration (related to root water uptake) and root electrical capacitance proved to be similar as they showed upward trends from seedling emergence to the beginning of flowering stage, and thereafter decreased continuously during fruit setting. A few days after arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-colonization, daily transpiration and root electrical capacitance of infected plants became significantly higher than those of non-infected counterparts, and the relative increment of the measured parameters was greater for the more highly mycorrhizal-dependent bean cultivar compared to that of cucumber. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization caused 29 and 69% relative increment in shoot dry mass for cucumbers and beans, respectively. Mycorrhization resulted in 37% increase in root dry mass for beans, but no significant difference was observed for cucumbers. Results indicate the potential of root electrical capacitance measurements for monitoring the changes and differences of root water uptake rate.

Bacteria endemic to saline coastal belt and their ability to mitigate the effects of salt stress on rice growth and yields	ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Salt-tolerant bacteria; Salt-sensitive rice variety; Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR); Nitrogen fixation; Indole acetic acid (IAA)	WHEAT TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; PLANT-GROWTH; ACC DEAMINASE; PROMOTING BACTERIA; SOIL; RHIZOSPHERE; TOLERANCE; ETHYLENE; PGPR; ARTHROBACTER	Increase in soil salinity adversely affects the metabolism and lowers the yield of rice (Oryza sativa L). Application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) to ameliorate the effects of salt stress on sensitive rice can be both effective and sustainable. In this study, 20 bacterial strains were isolated from the soil of saline-prone regions of Satkhira, north of the Sundarbans in coastal Bangladesh. Three bacteria among these grew well in the presence of 3 M salt (NaCl) and were Gram positive and non-motile. Their 16S rRNA sequence revealed that they belong to the Halobacillus genus. Two of them were identified as Halobacillus dabanensis strain SB-26 and the other one as Halobacillus sp. GSP 34. A couple of mechanisms by which these microbes could play beneficial role if associated with plants, such as nitrogen fixation and indole acetic acid (IAA) production, were identified. The two bacterial strains showed positive results for nitrogen fixation and indole acetic acid (IAA) activity under salt stress. Their effect on the physiology and yield of a farmer popular but sensitive BRRI dhan 28 rice variety was investigated under both control and salt stress. At the seedling stage, inoculated plants had significantly greater root length, shoot height, total weight, chlorophyll content, but lower electrolyte leakage both in control and salt stress (0, 40, and 80 mM). Performance of the plants was even better when both bacteria were used in combination. At the reproductive stage, the plants also showed better phenology in presence of the inoculated bacteria. Under stress (50 mM NaCl), these plants showed significantly greater plant height, lower spikelet damage, and yield reduction compared to untreated plants. The identified Halobacillus strains can therefore be used to improve the yield of rice by exploiting their plant growth promotion activities in coastal areas affected by moderate salinity, such as those with an ionic conductivity of up to 5 dS m(-1).

The experiment was performed on a randomized block design with five replicates and five sampling times, performed at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 days after emergence (DAE). Nine rhizobia isolates and the recommended strain (BR 2001) were inoculated on cowpea. Besides, it were used two control treatment: mineral nitrogen (TN, applying 150 mg N plant(-1)) and an absolute control (T0). Evaluating the number of nodules per plant (NN), nodule dry mass (NDM), plant dry matter (PDM), Accumulated N (N-ac), grain dry mass (GDM) and straw dry mass of pods (DMP). Results showed that the NN, NDM, PDM and Nac content increased until 45 DAE. Although variations had been occurred after 60 DAE for these parameters, significant difference was only found for Nac content at 75 DAE. Evaluated parameters (NN, NDM, PDM and Nac) showed a high correlation with GDM. Although no statistical difference had been observed to the strain BR 2001, five of the nine Bradyrhizobia isolates provided GDM production from 1.6 to 2.4 times more than the recommended strain, indicating high potential of use of these isolates as inoculant. However, further experiments are needed, mostly under field conditions to confirm these results.

This is a tropical region with a 7-9 month dry season and a monsoonal wet season. Complimentary methods of fungus detection were used to investigate the diversity and relative dominance of AMF at a regional scale. Soils were sampled from 32 sites, representing eucalypt savanna woodlands, wetlands, sandstone escarpment, rainforest, and disturbed mine waste rock dumps (overburden or spoil). Populations of AMF were identified and quantified using spores from soil. Morphology patterns of fungi colonising bait plant roots were examined and isolates were obtained by four complimentary pot-culturing methods. Different methods of detecting fungi produced different answers about which AMF were most important in the tested soils. In particular, spore surveys apparently underestimated the importance of Glomus species and overestimated the activity of Acaulospora species with numerous small spores, while calculated spore biovolumes overestimated the importance of Scutellospora and Gigaspora species with large spores, relative to inoculum levels of these fungus categories measured in bioassays. Spore surveys revealed 15 species of fungi and 8 additional fungi were recovered from the same soil samples using pot-culture isolation methods. Pot-cultures were especially important for detecting Glomus species that had high inoculum levels, but rarely produced spores in soils. Spores of AMF increased in abundance as vegetation developed in mine habitats reaching a peak that was higher than in undisturbed plant communities. Spore numbers (but not biovolumes) were well correlated with bioassay measurements of inoculum levels. Most AMF species were widespread, but several were restricted to disturbed habitats or wetland soils. Undisturbed sites had a substantially higher diversity of AMF than partially vegetated mine waste rock dumps. It is recommended that AMF population surveys should not be based entirely on spore occurrence data, to avoid overlooking important fungi that sporulate infrequently. These fungi could be detected by bioassays or pot culture isolation from soil. Major variations in the detectability of AMF correspond to different life history strategies and can mask variations in their abundance.

Fluctuations in AMF spore numbers could be related to environmental. seasonal and soil factors which affect AMF sporulation, in addition to the life history of the host plant. The aim of this Study was to asses the impact of spatial (resource islands vs open areas, OA) and seasonal (wet season vs start of dry season vs dry season) soil heterogeneity in the distribution and abundance of AMF spores in four different study sites within the Valley. We registered AMF spores in the 120 soil samples examined. Significant differences in the number of AMF spores were reported in the soil below the canopy of Mimosa species (RI) comparing with OA (RI > OA). and between Mimosa RI themselves when comparing along a soil gradient within the RI (soil near the trunk > soil below the middle of the canopy > soil in the margin of the canopy > OA): however, there were no significant differences between the soil closest to the trunk vs middle, and margin vs OA. Finally, more spores were reported in the soil collected during the wet season than during the dry season (wet > start of dry > Dry). Therefore, the distribution of AMF spores is affected by spatial and Seasonal soil heterogeneity. This Study points Out the relevance of Mimosa RI as AMF spore reservoirs and the potential importance of AM fungi for plant species survivorship and establishment in semi-arid regions. AM fungi have recently been recognized as an important factor determining plant species diversity in arid and temperate eco-systems.

For rhizobia in legume root nodules, diverting resources from nitrogen fixation to polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) has been discussed as a source of host-symbiont conflict. Yet, little is known about natural variation in PHB storage and its implications for rhizobial evolution. We therefore measured phenotypic variation in natural rhizObia populations and investigated how PHB might contribute to fitness in the free-living stage. We found that natural populations of rhizribia from Glycine max and Chamaecrista fasciculata had substantial, heritable variation in PHB acquisition during symbiosis. A model simulating temperature-dependent metabolic activity showed that the observed range of stored PHB per cell could support survival for a few days, for active cells, or over a century for sufficiently dormant cells. Experiments with field-isolated Bradyrhizobium in starvation culture suggest PHB is partitioned asymmetrically in dividing cells, consistent with individual-level bet-hedging previously demonstrated in E. meliloti. High-PHB isolates used more PHB over the first month, yet still retained more PHB for potential long-term survival in a dormant state. These results suggest that stored resources like PHB may support both short-term and long-term functions that contribute to fitness in the free-living stage.

J	366	MRW	Schreiner, R				Schreiner, R			Spatial and temporal variation of roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and plant and soil nutrients in a mature pinot noir (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard in oregon, USA	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						arbuscular colonization; Glomales; root growth; root nutrients; seasonal development; soil moisture; soil nutrients	CABERNET-SAUVIGNON GRAPEVINE; FREE AMINO ACIDS; NITROGEN; COLONIZATION; GROWTH; INFECTIVITY; CULTIVARS; INOCULUM; DENSITY; CITRUS	The spatial and temporal development of grapevine roots and associated mycorrhizal fungi was studied in 1999 and 2000 in a 21-year-old, Pinot Noir (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard located on a Jory soil (Palehumult, silty clay loam) in Oregon, USA. The density of woody roots and fine (primary) roots deemed to be physiologically active (based on color and cellular integrity) were determined at monthly intervals in the weed-free, vine row and in the alleyway between rows at two depths (0-50 and 50-100 cm). The majority of fine roots were growing in the vine row at 0-50 cm depth. Fine root density did not change dramatically over the 1999 or 2000 seasons until the time of fruit harvest in the fall. Apparently, new root growth kept pace with turnover (death) prior to harvest, but new root growth surpassed turnover in the fall after fruit harvest. Colonization of fine roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) was consistently high in the vine row at 0-50 cm depth, but was lower in roots growing in the alleyway, and in roots below 50 cm. The proportion of fine roots containing arbuscules (the site of nutrient exchange in arbuscular mycorrhizas) was also greatest for roots growing in the vine row at 0-50 cm depth. Arbuscular colonization of these roots increased prior to budbreak in the spring, reached a high level (50-60% root length) by early summer, and remained high until after the time of leaf senescence in late fall. Arbuscular colonization decreased rapidly by December of 1999 when November rainfall exceeded 200 mm, but did not decline by December of 2000 when November rainfall was below 80 mm. The availability of important plant nutrients in the soil, with the exception of Mg and Zn, was higher in the upper 50 cm of the soil profile where the majority of roots were found. In addition, available nitrate and phosphate were higher in the vine row than in the alleyway soil. Seasonal changes in leaf nutrient concentrations of Pinot Noir confirmed findings in other cultivars, but fluctuations of N, P, and K concentrations in fine roots over the season suggested that fine roots may play a role in nutrient storage, as well as nutrient uptake, in grapevines. Grapevines grown in Oregon direct significant resources to roots and AMF after fruit harvest and substantial post-harvest nutrient uptake may extend into the early winter.

Sorghum seeds were sown in polyethylene pots of 3 L. filled with desinfested substrate, composed of a mixture of soil and sand (2:1). Twelve days after emergence, each plant was inoculated with pure populations of M. javanica, R. reniformis or P. brachyurus, respectively in each experiment. 'BRS 360RR' soybean, 'BRS Cedro' cotton and 'BRS 1010' corn cultivars were used as susceptible standards, respectively in M. javanica, R. reniformis or P. brachyurus experiments. (Crotalaria spectabilis) was used as resistant standard in all experiments. The experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with eight replications. After 60 or 90 days after the inoculations, respectively for M. javanica and R. reniformis or P. brachyurus experiments, nematodes were extracted from the roots and the reproduction factors and nematodes per gram of roots were estimated. Based on the evaluated variables, sweet sorghum cultivars 'BRS 506', 'BRS 508', 'BRS 509' and 'BRS 511' may be considered resistant to R reniformis and M. javanica, and susceptible to P. brachyurus.

Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) has isometric virus particles (25 nm in diameter) that contain two ssRNA species (RNA1 and RNA2) and three capsid proteins (Vp25, Vp20, and Vp24). ALSV vectors are used for foreign gene expression and virus-induced gene silencing in a broad range of plant species. Here, we report the infection by ALSV vectors that express FLOWERING LOCUS T (AtFT) from Arabidopsis thaliana or its homolog GtFT1 from Gentiana triflora in three gentian cultivars ('Iwate Yume Aoi' [early flowering], 'Iwate' [medium flowering], and 'Alta' [late flowering]), and two lisianthus cultivars ('Newlination Pink ver. 2' and 'Torukogikyou daburu mikkusu') promotes flowering within 90 days post-inoculation using particle bombardment. Additionally, seedlings from the progeny of the early-flowering plants were tested by tissue blot hybridization, and the results showed that ALSV was not transmitted to the next generation. The promotion of flowering in the family Gentianaceae by ALSV vectors shortened the juvenile phase from 1-3 years to 3-5 months, and thus, it could be considered as a new plant breeding technique in ornamental gentian and lisianthus plants.

Gast Rearing Laboratory, Mississippi State, MS isolate) contaminated artificial diet on Lygus hesperus Knight (Heteroptera: Miridae) is described. A standard number of A. niger spores was inoculated into an artificial diet used to rear L. hesperus, and the effect on biological fitness of the insect was measured. Biological fitness was defined as total number of surviving adults, mean biomass (dry weight) accumulated per cage over the total test period, egg production, time to adult emergence, and time to the beginning of egg laying. These measurements were all significantly different for insects reared on the inoculated diet from those reared on the control diet. The insects reared on the diet inoculated with A. niger showed a high mortality of nymphs, a decrease in mean biomass, delayed development time, and a decrease in egg production. This study demonstrates the devastating effect A. niger diet contamination can have on a laboratory colony of L. hesperus and emphasizes the need for constant vigilance and adherence to strict sanitation methods in an insect rearing facility.

Ensuring seed lot sanitary quality is the most efficient control strategy against bacterial diseases. Currently, the procedures adopted in the control of seed lots are mainly based on microbiological techniques combined with PCR or plant inoculation which is time and money consuming. The aim of this study was to propose a reliable and rapid detection technique of living X. c. pv. campestris in cabbage seeds. We have shown that not all cells of X. campestris is able to grown on rich medium after washing and soaking seeds as no colony of X. campestris was detected on inoculated seeds, whereas plantlets develop symptoms 7-14 days after germination. The PCR technique used alone does not address the viability of bacteria in samples. We set up a technique named seed-qPCR for the detection of living X. c. pv. campestris bacterial cells in seed lots. This technique is based on an enrichment of bacterial population associated with infected seeds by seed germination coupled with real-time Taq-man PCR after extraction of the target DNA. It is an inexpensive technique that allow the detection of down to 1 contaminated seed among 10 000 healthy seeds. The seed-qPCR method combines an efficient extraction based on bacterial multiplication on seedlings with a sensitive technique qPCR for the detection of bacteria in seed lots.

While the genetics of resource allocation is well established, the regulatory role of plant-associated microorganisms is still unclear. Here, we demonstrate that plant-associated microorganisms can reposition the plant phenotype along the same growth-defense tradeoff that determines phenotypic effects of plant mutations. We grew plants with microorganisms altering ethylene balance, a key hormone regulating plant investment into growth and stress tolerance. Microbial ethylene reduction had a similar effect to mutations disrupting ethylene signaling: both increased plant growth but at the cost of a strong stress hypersensitivity. We conclude that microbial impact on phenotype can offset the effects of mutations and that apparent plant growth promotion has strong pleiotropic effects. This study confirms that plant life history should be addressed as a joint product of plant genotype and its associated microbiota.

However, the contribution of this process may be limited by adverse conditions to symbiotic bacteria, such as fungicide seed treatments. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the fungicides carbendazim + thiram and carboxin + thiram on soybean nodulation, plant growth and grain yield. Two field experiments were carried out in the Cerrado region of the State of Roraima, in a soil with a low organic matter content and no soybean bradyrhizobia. In 2005, seeds were treated with fungicide carbendazim + thiram and commercial inoculants containing the Bradyrhizobium elkanii strains SEMIA 5019 and SEMIA 587 and B.japonicum strains SEAM 5079 and SEMIA 5080. In 2006, soybean seeds were treated with the fungicides carbendazim + thiram or carboxin + thiram and inoculated separately with each one of the four strains. The plants were evaluated for number of nodules and dry weight, shoot dry weight and total N accumulated in shoots 35 days after plant emergence, while grain yield and N grain content were determined at harvest. Both fungicides reduced soybean nodulation, especially in the presence of B. elkanii strains. The fungicide carbendazim + thiram reduced nodulation by about 50 % and grain yield by more than 20 % (about 700 kg ha(-1)), in the treatment inoculated with of strain SEMIA 587.

Trusses of fruit both at the ripe and mature green phase were treated with UV-C doses of 3 and 8 kJ/m(2). Ripe fruit were picked 8 h after treatment and kept at room temperature for up to 16 d during which colour development and texture were monitored and compared to untreated controls. Mature green fruit treated on the vine with UV-C doses of 3 or 8 kJ/m(2) showed only a slight loss in green pigmentation in contrast to the tomato colour index (TCI) of control fruit which increased sharply 5 d after treatment. The TCI of ripe fruit treated with UV-C at a dose of 8 kJ/m(2) showed a lag of 10 d before increasing to a final value comparable to that of untreated fruit. Fruit treated with a dose of 3 kJ/m(2) did not display a lag but the increase in TCI occurred at a lower rate than for the controls. Firmness remained higher in fruit treated with the highest UV-C dose compared to fruit treated with the lower UV-C dose and controls. Fruit covered with UV impermeable film on the same plants as those that had received a UV-C dose of 3 kJ/m(2) had become ripe by day 6 in a manner similar to that of the controls. By contrast, fruit from trusses adjacent to those that had been treated with a UV-C dose of 8 kJ/m(2) remained green over the same period of time. Ripe fruit treated as described above were inoculated with spores of Penicillium digitatum after UV-C treatment and their firmness monitored over 12 d. A dose response effect was found with fruit treated at the highest dose remaining firmer than those treated at the lower dose and the controls. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

Life history theory predicts that plants in adverse environments for juvenile performance start reproduction at smaller sizes and exhibit higher reproductive allocation compared to their counterparts in favourable environments. Life history theory will gain in generality if its predictions are shown to apply to a broad range of organisms and modes of reproduction. This study tested whether the asexual reproductive strategy of a lichenized fungus changed along a climatic gradient. Methods The variation in threshold size for asexual reproduction and asexual reproductive allocation of the lichen Lobarina scrobiculata was assessed in 18 populations (9665 individuals) along a climatic gradient spanning 800km in latitude in Southern Europe. Using generalized linear models and standardized major axis regressions, the allometric relationships and the associated variation in climatic factors according to the changes in the threshold size for reproduction and reproductive allocation patterns were assessed. Key Results The onset of reproduction was size-dependent and the reproductive allocation increased with individual size. Both the threshold size for reproduction and the reproductive allocation varied along the rainfall gradient. A lower threshold size for reproduction and higher reproductive allocation in drier, adverse locations were found. Therefore, populations in drier locations fitted the predictions of life history theory for sexually reproducing organisms in adverse environments for juvenile performance. Conclusions This study highlights the applicability of the life history theory to fungi and to modes of reproduction other than sexual reproduction. Based on the intraspecific variation in the asexual reproductive strategy of a fungal organism with climatic factors, these findings expand the scope of life history theory predictions and increase our understanding of life history diversity and reproductive strategies across environments.

However, the performance of the bean crop originating from seeds enriched with P and Mo has not yet been assessed under field conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of sowing seeds enriched with P and Mo, harvested from plants that received foliar sprayings of P or Mo or both, on growth and yield of common bean crop. Seeds with contrasting concentrations of P and Mo were sown in three field experiments in Brazil (in 2006 and 2008 in Rio de Janeiro State, and in 2009 in Goias State) with different N sources (control without N. seed with rhizobia inoculation, rhizobia inoculation plus 40 kg N ha(-1) side-dressed, mineral N with 60 kg N ha(-1)). In 2006, seeds enriched with P and Mo increased nodule mass at 32 days after emergence (DAE), shoot N and biomass at 48 DAE, and grain yield and N content, for most combinations of the three cultivars and N sources evaluated. In 2008, the highest shoot growth at 57 DAE and grain yield were obtained with low-P high-Mo seeds, which was partially due to the higher Mo concentration of these seeds. In 2009, seeds enriched with P and Mo increased nodule mass at 34 DAE and grain yield but only for plants receiving inoculation plus side-dressed N. The results demonstrate the benefits of seeds with high concentrations of P and Mo for improving bean yield, although such yield increases were more effective for plants inoculated with rhizobia than amended with N. Sowing enriched seeds, associated with rhizobia inoculation and side-dressed N. provided grain yields much higher than the average common bean yields in Brazil. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

C-3 plant-'C-4 soil' (obtained from a grassland dominated by C-4 grasses) and C-4 plant-'C-3 soil' (obtained from a pasture dominated by C-3 grasses). were used in this study to monitor the dynamics of rhizosphere respiration (root-derived CO2-C) at different plant developmental stages. In C-3 plant-'C-4 soil' system. CO2-C derived from soybean roots increased significantly from vegetative stage (55.69 mg C d(-1) pot(-1)) to flowering stage (132.18 mg C d(-1) pot(-1)), and it declined thereafter (83.37-111.63 mg C d(-1) pot(-1)). However, no significant change of CO2-C derived from sunflower roots was observed at different plant developmental stages (67.05-77.66 mg C d(-1) pot(-1)). CO2-C derived from soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr) roots was significantly higher than that derived from sunflower (Helianthus annuus) roots except for that at vegetative stage. In C-4 plant 'C-3 soil' system. CO2-C derived from sorghum roots was significantly higher at flowering stage (169.51 mg C d(-1) pot(-1)) than at other stages (75.89-113.26 mg C d(-1) pot(-1)). C-2-C derived from amaranthus roots was the highest at vegetative stage (88.88 mg C d(-1) pot(-1)) and it declined significantly thereafter (23.42-53.47 mg C d(-1) pot(-1))-CO2-C derived from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) roots was significantly higher than that front amaranthus (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) roots except for that at vegetative stage. In conclusion, rhizosphere respiration varied not only with plant species but also with plant phenology. With the soil volume used in our pots. the overall percentages of cumulative root-derived CO2-C to total soil respiration were 61.22, 61.14. 81.84 and 67.37% for soybean. sunflower. sorghum and amaranthus, respectively. Specific rhizosphere respiration was also discussed and was used as an index of root activity and vitality.

We explored correlations between leaf nutrient availability and endophyte diversity amongPinus muricataandVaccinium ovatumplants growing across a soil nutrient gradient spanning a series of coastal terraces in Mendocino, California. Endophyte richness decreased in plants with higher leaf nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios for both host species, but increased with sodium, which may be toxic to fungi at high concentrations. Isolation frequency, a proxy of fungal biomass, was not significantly predicted by any of the same leaf constituents in the two plant species. We propose that stressed plants can exhibit both low foliar nutrients or high levels of toxic compounds, and that both of these stress responses predict endophyte species richness. Stressful conditions that limit growth of fungi may increase their diversity due to the suppression of otherwise dominating species. Differences between the host species in their endophyte communities may be explained by host specificity, leaf phenology, or microclimates.

Oil generation, assumed to be associated with organic lipids, is considered as related to the origin and chemical evolution of the biosphere and to the geodynamic and deposition histories of source rocks. The presented reconstruction outlines the Archean and Proterozoic evolution and biochemistry of organic matter and main biochemical changes in bacteria and plants. Two key events of life history caused critical influence on oil generation: i) the onset of life and the biosphere in the Archean and ii) the onset of land plants in the Late Paleozoic. Land plants provided a new type of organic matter, the source of oil, and expanded the scope of source rock facies and increased the scale of gas formation. Hydrocarbon generation evolved periodically in several intensity cycles correlated with the directed Earth's evolution.

Merr. cv. Evans) was investigated under field conditions to test the hypotheses that: (i) the tripartite symbiosis enhances nodulation and nodule activity; and (ii) its establishment does not rely on improved phosphorus (P) uptake through the fungal partner. Soil tillage was used to produce treatments with contrasting AMF colonization potentials while the amount of B. japonicum inoculum was kept constant. Nodulation, AMF colonization and the P and nitrogen (N) nutrition of plants were evaluated at 10 and 51 (full-bloom) days after emergence. N(2) fixation was estimated by the difference method and by the isotopic dilution method. At the early stage of plant growth, AMF hyphal colonization and nodulation were, respectively, 16 % and 33 % greater in plants from untilled than from rototilled soil. The establishment of the tripartite symbiosis was observed under field conditions, and factors other than P nutrition were critical to its formation. However, the tripartite symbiosis did not promote N(2) fixation under the high soil P conditions of this study.

In this study we evaluated the distribution and abundance of mycorrhizal associations in alpine plant communities to gain a better Understanding of the potential effects of microhabitat and host identity oil plant-fungus mutualisms. We surveyed the abundance of ectomycorrhizae (ECM) associated with Salix sp. and the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AMF) associated with Taraxacum ceratophorum, T officinale, Polemonium viscosum, and P. delicatum in plots under willow canopies and in adjacent open meadows. AMF colonization of T ceratophorum, T officinale, and P. viscosum was greater in open meadow than ill understory habitats. Conversely, ECM abundance was greater ill the willow understory than in the surrounding open meadow. AMF abundance in three of the four host species was negatively correlated with ECM abundance in the soil microsite. Taraxacum ceratophorum showed consistently high colonization by AMF regardless of habitat or ECM abundance. Our results suggest that willow-mediated heterogeneity in light and nutrient availability influence the distribution of AMF associations across the willow-meadow ecotone. Furthermore, species-specific plant life history traits related to growth strategies, carbon allocation patterns, and stress tolerance likely affect mycorrhizal dependence and interspecific variation in mycorrhizal associations.

Lack of sex-specific differences in mycorrhizal associations and response to herbivory in the gynodioecious herb, Polemonium foliosissimum	PLANT ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizae; Gynodioecy; Polemonium; Simulated herbivory; Plant-sizedependent; Multi-species interactions	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA; REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS; SPORE GERMINATION; PLANT-GROWTH; FUNGI; COLONIZATION; EVOLUTION; ROOTS; TEMPERATURE; SYMBIOSIS	For decades, evolutionary plant biologists have been interested in how females reap a fitness advantage and are thus maintained in gynodioecious plants. Recent attention has focused on the role of multi-species interactions in the maintenance of females, wherein the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is virtually unknown. AMF form symbiotic associations with plants, often resulting in enhanced nutrient acquisition and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. Depending on the degree to which females and hermaphrodites rely on their AMF partners, AMF could differentially affect plant tolerance to stress. We conducted a field experiment to examine (1) if females and hermaphrodites of the gynodioecious herb, Polemonium foliosissimum, differentially associate with AMF, and (2) if there was a difference in AMF colonization between the sexes after imposing stress by simulating herbivore damage. First, we compared mycorrhizal colonization between the sexes under ambient (i.e., undamaged) field conditions. Then, for a second set of plants, we simulated herbivory by clipping plants and compared mycorrhizal colonization, leaf phosphorus concentration [P], and fruit and seed production between clipped and control plants. Mycorrhizal colonization did not differ between sexes under ambient field conditions or under the stress imposed by clipping. Clipping did, however, influence both percent root length and vesicle colonization in a plant-size-dependent manner. Overall, colonization and vesicle number increased with plant size for clipped plants, but decreased with size for non-clipped plants. Leaf [P] did not differ between the sexes nor was influenced by clipping, and leaf [P] was not associated with mycorrhizal colonization. Furthermore, neither fruit set nor seed production was associated with mycorrhizal colonization. Our findings suggest that the sexes of P. foliosissimum do not differentially associate with nor differentially garner benefit from mycorrhizal fungi. However, a complete accounting of the costs and benefits of AMF for gynodioecious species must encompass the full life-history of the plant.

Bacillus subtilis colonizes rhizosphere of plants and releases some volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can modulate the growth and root architecture in several plants. However, the influence of VOCs on growth and root architecture in soybean remains unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that VOCs would enhance the growth of soybean and change its root architecture. Thus, experiments under growth chamber were carried out to investigate the effect of VOCs released by B. subtilis AP-3 on growth and root architecture of soybean (control and plants exposed to VOCs) and eight replicates. Plant growth and root architecture parameters in soybean were measured 20 days after soybean emergence. Soybean exposed to microbial VOCs displayed significant increase in plant biomass (88% and 18% for shoot and roots, respectively) than the control. Microbial VOCs changed the root architecture of soybean that exhibited roots with higher length, diameter, surface area, and volume. The principal component analysis differentiated plants exposed to VOCs from those plants without exposure. The findings from this study are important since the modulation of root architecture can improve the absorption of water and nutrients from the soil.

Chitosan is known to have a direct antifungal effect and acts also as an elicitor capable of stimulating a defense response in plants. However, there is little information regarding the genes that are either activated or repressed in fruits treated with chitosan. The aim of this study was to identify by RNA-seq the genes differentially regulated by the action of low molecular weight chitosan in the avocado-chitosan-Colletotrichuminteraction system. The samples for RNA-seq were obtained from fruits treated with chitosan, fruits inoculated with Colletotrichum and fruits both treated with chitosan and inoculated with the fungus. Non-treated and non-inoculated fruits were also analyzed. Expression profiles showed that in short times, the fruit-chitosan system presented a greater number of differentially expressed genes, compared to the fruit-pathogen system. Gene Ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes showed a large number of metabolic processes regulated by chitosan, including those preventing the spread of Colletotrichum. It was also found that there is a high correlation between the expression of genes in silico and qPCR of several genes involved in different metabolic pathways.

Interaction studies investigating H. avenae and its hosts are still in their infancy. In this study, a barley model plant, the Hordeum vulgare cultivar Golden Promise, was investigated for its potential as a candidate model host to study its interaction with H. avenae. CCN-infective juveniles were attracted by the root tips and gathered around the root elongation zones of Golden Promise on 0.7% water agar plates. The juveniles invaded the roots and developed successfully until maturation at 40 days after inoculation in sterile sand soil. The cryotomy and syncytium measurements indicated that the syncytia enlarged gradually throughout the development of the nematodes and caused the corresponding root regions to swell obviously. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the down-regulation of defence-related barley genes and up-regulation of development-related barley genes contribute to the understanding of compatible interaction between H. avenae and Golden Promise. Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) can be used in the roots of Golden Promise. In conclusion, the Hordeum vulgare cultivar Golden Promise is a suitable candidate model host for interaction studies with Heterodera avenae. The studies presented above document the first CCN host that not only has published genome context but also be compatible to BSMV VIGS.

Previous studies have shown that microbial communities harbored within insects vary through ontogenetic development and among insects feeding on different host-plant species. In this study, we characterized the bacterial microbiota of the highly polyphagous Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), at different instars and when feeding on different host-plant species. Our results show that the bacterial microbiota hosted within the Mediterranean fruit fly differs among instars and host-plant species. Most of the bacteria harbored by the Mediterranean fruit fly belong to the phylum Proteobacteria, including genera of Alphaproteobacteria such as Acetobacterand Gluconobacter, Betaprotobacteria such as Burkholderia and Gammaproteobacteria such as Pseudomonas.

The negative impact of salinity for plants such as delay germination time, growth inhibition, reduce nodules formation, decrease biomass accumulation, and reduce yield quantity and quality. Initial selection for salt resistance of soybean, conducted on 16 genotypes, using three levels of NaCl and three replications. Germination conducted for six days, in germinator which has been set at 25 degrees C, with lighting. Mean Germination Time (MGT), Final Germination Percent (FGP), sprout length (root and overall) and weight (fresh and dry), seedling vigor index (length and weight) were observed. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, followed by LSD at 5%. Sixteen soybean genotypes show inhibition effect of salinity. The results showed that 125 mM NaCl does not inhibit germination but it causes abnormal growth at some genotypes. Number of normal germination decreased 20-30% at 125 mM NaCl. Sprouts total length declined by 17-58% at 75 mM and 45-78% at 125 mM NaCl. Root length decrease from 23.2-55.3% at 75 mM and 52.1-81.2% in 125 mM. Fresh weight diminish by 3.8-39.9% at 75 mM and 12.7-52.5% at 125 mM NaCl. Response of sixteen soybean genotypes into salinity stress is clearly visible at sprout length and fresh weight variable. Ichiyou was salt-sensitive based on all variable especially sprout length and fresh weight, while Baluran was salt-tolerant up to 125 mM NaCl based on sprout length and fresh weight.

The direct and indirect benefits of the element for crops (especially grasses) are related to resistance to diseases, pests, and drought. Since most studies were done with fertilizers applied to the soil, new studies on the efficacy of silicon absorption through the leaves are required. The effect of silicon absorption through the leaves on rice blast (Pyricularia oryzae) control was studied using potassium silicate (K2SiO3) in different doses (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 g L-1 Si), number of sprayings at two solution pHs. Rice (Oryza sativa), cultivar 'Metica 1' (susceptible to blast), was grown in pots in a completely randomized experimental design. Silicate was applied beginning at the 22nd day after emergence (DAE). The pathogen was inoculated on the 25th DAE. Disease incidence was evaluated ten days after inoculation. Potassium silicate pulverization on the leaves did not increase Si absorption or accumulation by the plant; however, there was a reduction on blast incidence. The greatest reduction on blast incidence was observed at 4 g Si L-1, regardless of solution pH.

Since high temperatures affect quality of fruits and leaves in grapevine and the association of Tempranillo with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhances the antioxidant properties of berries and leaves, we assessed the effect of elevated air temperature and mycorrhization, separately or combined, on the nutritional properties of Tempranillo leaves at the time of fruit harvest. Experimental assay included three clones (CL-260, CL-1048, and CL-1089) and two temperature regimes (24/14 degrees C or 28/18 degrees C day/night) during fruit ripening. Within each clone and temperature regime there were plants not inoculated or inoculated with AMF. The nutritional value of leaves increased under warming climate: elevated temperatures induced the accumulation of minerals, especially in CL-1089; antioxidant capacity and soluble sugars also increased in CL-1089; CL-260 showed enhanced amounts of pigments, and chlorophylls and soluble proteins increased in CL-1048. Results suggested the possibility of collecting leaves together with fruit harvest with different applications of every clone: those from CL-1089 would be adequate for an energetic diet and leaves from CL-260 and CL-1048 would be suitable for culinary processes. Mycorrhization improved the nutritional value of leaves by enhancing flavonols in all clones, hydroxycinnamic acids in CL-1089 and carotenoids in CL-260.	[Torres, Nazareth; Antolin, M.

Genetic material was examined for resistance to P. neglectus, and included 2 susceptible local commercial wheat varieties (Spear, Molineux), 2 derivatives from Spear (RAC 613-27, RAC 613-47), wheat varieties varying in reaction to P. thornei, rye and rye derivatives, triticales, and 1R substitution lines in Chinese Spring. Seeds were surface-sterilised and germinated, and 3-day-old seedlings were inoculated with about 250 larvae and 150 eggs. Plants were grown in pots containing pasteurised soil and transferred to a controlled temperature waterbath at 22 +/- 1 degrees C. After 7 weeks, nematodes were extracted and counted. A significant difference for the number of nematodes per plant and per gram dry root was found between the 3 main groups of genetic material: the wheat varieties, the substitution lines, and lines with the whole genome of rye (including triticales). The triticales Abacus and Muir showed the lowest number of nematodes (per gram root and per plant). None of the wheat varieties was resistant, so genetic mechanisms conferring resistance or tolerance to P. thornei are not effective against P. neglectus.

These Phaseolus species showed to be very contrasting in respect to the pattern of nitrate reductase (NR) activity distribution thought the plant. The highest level of NR activity in P. vulgaris was clearly shown to occur in leaves in contrast with the lowest one detected in roots and nodules as widely seen for other tropical species of the Phaseoleae tribe. Conversely, P. lunatus had higher NR activity in the nodules, whereas its leaves exhibited a steadily decrease during the plant development. Indeed, at 32 days after emergence (pre-flowering stage), the nodulated P. vulgaris had approximately 95% of the total NR activity localized in its leaves, whereas in P. lunatus it was equally distributed in the nodules and in the leaves. Under long-term exposure to increasing exogenous level of nitrate, the leaf-NR activity of nodulated P. vulgaris presented a positive response, whereas the enzyme activity was very low and unresponsive in P. lunatus. In contrast, the nodule-NR activity showed a reverse response to the increasing NO; level. The nodule-NR activity of P. lunatus significantly increased whereas in the P. vulgaris nodules it was very low and unresponsive. This present study suggests that P. lunatus inoculated with Rhizobium tropici presents a singular pattern of nitrate reduction distribution among leaves and nodules during the vegetative development. It is speculated that the nodulated Phaseolus lunatus may have different NR isoforms in their leaves (at least a constitutive type) and an inducible form in their nodules, responsive to long-term exposure to nitrate.

We explored the effect of long-term N and NPK fertilization on soil bacterial diversity and community composition using meta-analysis of a global dataset. Nitrogen fertilization decreased soil pH, and increased soil organic carbon (C) and available N contents. Bacterial taxonomic diversity was decreased by N fertilization alone, but was increased by NPK fertilization. The effect of N fertilization on bacterial diversity varied with soil texture and water management, but was independent of crop type or N application rate. Changes in bacterial diversity were positively related to both soil pH and organic C content under N fertilization alone, but only to soil organic C under NPK fertilization. Microbial biomass C decreased with decreasing bacterial diversity under long-term N fertilization. Nitrogen fertilization increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, but reduced the abundance of Acidobacteria, consistent with the general life history strategy theory for bacteria. The positive correlation between N application rate and the relative abundance of Actinobacteria indicates that increased N availability favored the growth of Actinobacteria. This first global analysis of long-term N and NPK fertilization that differentially affects bacterial diversity and community composition provides a reference for nutrient management strategies for maintaining belowground microbial diversity in agro-ecosystems worldwide.

It has been found that, at about 35 days after emergence, the number of fresh nodules per plant ranged from 20 to 46 in the nitrogen-free version, with an average of about 33 nodules/plant. Since nodules were found at 80 plants/m(2), it results a number of 2,640 nodules/m(2). By weighing after oven drying, it was measured 38.24 mg/plant, which is 3.06 g/m(2) and 30.6 kg/ha. Using the balance (difference) method, the calculated amount of nitrogen extracted from peas was 262.5 kg/ha, as follows: N-biologically (fixed) = 262.5 - 135 (control wheat) = 127.5 kg N/ha (2-year average for Belmondo peas). It results that for each kg of dry nodules a quantity of 4.17 kg N has been synthesized - a nitrogen calculation coefficient. In a crop rotation with 25% peas and a surface of 1,600 ha, an amount of 51 t N/ha is fixed, which represents 24.5% or 29.4 (sic)/ha. Research is part of a program meant to reduce conventional inputs and increase farm profitability.

Interactive Effects of Temperature and Leaf Wetness Duration on Sporangia Germination and Infection of Cucurbit Hosts by Pseudoperonospora cubensis	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							DOWNY MILDEW; DISEASE PROGRESS; RESISTANCE; WHEAT; CULTIVARS; CUCUMBERS; MODELS; RUST	Neufeld, K. N., and Ojiambo, P. S. 2012. Interactive effects of temperature and leaf wetness duration on sporangia germination and infection of cucurbit hosts by Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Plant Dis. 96:345-353. Outbreaks of cucurbit downy mildew caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis are dependent on the weather but effects of temperature and leaf wetness duration on infection have not been studied for different cucurbits. To determine the effects of these two weather variables on sporangia germination and infection of cucurbit host types by P cubensis, three host types; cucumber ('Straight 8'), cantaloupe ('Kermit'), and acorn squash ('Table Queen'), were inoculated and exposed to leaf wetness durations of 2 to 24 h at six constant temperatures ranging from 5 to 30 degrees C in growth-chamber experiments. Sporangia germination was assessed after each wetness period, and leaf area infected was assessed 5 and 7 days after inoculation. Germination of sporangia was highest on cantaloupe (16.5 to 85.7%) and lowest on squash (10.7 to 68.9%), while disease severity was highest and lowest on cucumber and cantaloupe, respectively. Host type, temperature, wetness duration and their interactions significantly (P < 0.0001) affected germination and disease severity. Germination and disease data for each host type were separately fitted to a modified form of a Weibull function that characterizes a unimodal response and monotonic increase of germination or infection with temperature and wetness duration, respectively. The effect of host type on germination and infection was characterized primarily by differences in the upper limit parameter in response to temperature. Differences among host types based on other parameters were either small or inconsistent. Temperature and wetness duration that supported a given level of germination or infection varied among host types. At 20 degrees C, 15% leaf area infected was expected following 2, 4, and 8 h of wetness for cucumber, squash, and cantaloupe, respectively. When temperature was increased to 25 degrees C, 15% disease severity was expected following 3, 7, and 15 h of wetness for cucumber, squash, and cantaloupe, respectively. Risk charts were constructed to estimate the potential risk of infection of cucurbit host types by P cubensis based on prevailing or forecasted temperature and leaf wetness duration. These results will improve the timing and application of the initial fungicide spray for the control of cucurbit downy mildew.	[Neufeld, K. N.; Ojiambo, P.

The experimental design was of randomized blocks in a 3 x 7 factorial scheme, corresponding to the three cultivars (Carioca precoce, Rosinha and Ouro negro), and seven molybdic fertilization schemes, with three replications. The Ouro Negro cultivar showed a higher number of nodules and shoot dry-matter compared to Carioca precoce and Rosinha, and the Carioca and Ouro Negro cultivars achieved the highest number of grains per pod, hundred-grain weight and yield, than the Rosinha cultivar after fertilization with molybdenum and nitrogen. Nitrogen fertilization reduced the formation of nodules in the Carioca precoce and Rosinha cultivars, but increased most agronomic characteristics and yield in comparison to molybdic fertilization. However, the fragmented application of molybdenum between 15 and 30 days after emergence (DAE), positively influenced the formation of nodules, leaf-nitrogen levels, the number of grains per pod, hundred-grain weight and yield, compared to molybdenum application by seed, or the absence of fertilization, for the three cultivars studied, indicating that molybdic foliar fertilization is considered essential for increasing the productivity of bean cultivars.

Xylella fastidiosa pauca ST53 is the plant pathogenic bacterium responsible for the disease, and the adult Meadow Spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius (L.) (Hemiptera Aphrophoridae), is its main vector. This study proposes a lattice model for the pathogen invasion of olive orchard aimed at identifying an appropriate strategy for arresting the infection, built on the management of the vector throughout its entire life cycle. In our model the olive orchard is depicted as a simple square lattice with olive trees and herbaceous vegetation distributed on the lattice sites in order to mimic the typical structure of an olive orchard; adult vectors are represented by particles moving on the lattice according to rules dictated by the interplay between vector and vegetation life cycles or phenology; the transmission process of the bacterium is regulated by a stochastic Susceptible, Infected and Removed model. On this baseline model, we build-up a proper Integrated Pest Management strategy based on tailoring, timing, and tuning of available control actions. We demonstrate that it is possible to reverse the hitherto unstoppable Xylella fastidiosa pauca ST53 invasion, by a rational vector and transmission control strategy.

(Rutaceae) against the most devastating root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita responsible for colossal yield losses in cucumber. The leaves of C. sativa and Z. alatum were incorporated in the soil at the rate of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 20 g per kg of soil. After decomposition, cucumber (cv. Royal Sluis) seeds were sown and inoculated with 2000 s stage juveniles of M. incognita ten days after emergence. Data on growth variables and nematode infestations were recorded after six weeks of inoculation. Both the plants significantly reduced nematode infestations and enhanced plant growth criteria compared to the untreated check. The reductions in number of galls, egg masses, nematode fecundity and build up caused by C sativa were significantly higher as compared to Z. alatum. Maximum reductions in these variables were recorded with 20 g dosage. The addition of C sativa and Z alatum to the soil as organic amendment can work very well as nematicides and can be successfully used for controlling root-knot nematodes replacing traditional chemical treatments and avoiding environmental pollution.

These fungi have been studied both because of their unique predatory life history and because they are potential control agents of important plant- and animal-parasitic nematodes. Ecological studies of nematode-trapping fungi have primarily used culture-based methods, but molecular detection techniques are now available and should be useful for studying this group. We developed Orbiliales-specific PCR primers for the ITS and 28s rDNA to directly detect nematode-trapping fungi without culturing and also to screen fungal isolates for phylogenetic placement in the Orbiliales. We used these primers to selectively amplify, clone, and sequence Orbiliales DNA extracted from soil, litter, and wood, and we compared the results of molecular detection with those obtained using a culture-based method. Of the eight species of nematode-trapping Orbiliales detected with the culture-based assay, only three were detected with PCR. The molecular assay, however, detected 18 species of uncultured Orbiliales, many of which are closely related to nematode-trapping fungi and fungal parasites of nematode eggs. Our results suggest that the combined use of Orbiliales-specific primers and culture-based techniques may benefit future studies of nematophagous fungi.

The highest levels of carbendazim were detected in the coleoptiles four days after germination of seeds and the radicals contained the lowest concentrations. Carbendazim residues declined with time in the shoot portions of seedlings and of adult plants. However, the levels of carbendazim detected in the shoot tissues of 21-day-old seedlings grown from treated seeds [recommended dose of 10 mg a.i. 10 g-1 seeds] and in adult plants 35 days after treatment (recommended dose of 0.25 g a.i. litre-1 spray fluid) correspond to the reported lasting ability of the fungicide in terms of protection against blast of rice.

INVASION; ECOLOGY; GROWTH; METAANALYSIS	It is still debated whether alien plants benefit from being mycorrhizal, or if engaging in the symbiosis constrains their establishment and spread in new regions. We analyzed the association between mycorrhizal status of alien plant species in Germany and their invasion success. We compared whether the representation of species with different mycorrhizal status (obligate, facultative, or non-mycorrhizal) differed at several stages of the invasion process. We used generalized linear models to explain the occupied geographical range of alien plants, incorporating interactions of mycorrhizal status with plant traits related to morphology, reproduction, and life-history. Non-naturalized aliens did not differ from naturalized aliens in the relative frequency of different mycorrhizal status categories. Mycorrhizal status significantly explained the occupied range of alien plants; with facultative mycorrhizal species inhabiting a larger range than non-mycorrhizal aliens and obligate mycorrhizal plant species taking an intermediate position. Aliens with storage organs, shoot metamorphoses, or specialized structures promoting vegetative dispersal occupied a larger range when being facultative mycorrhizal. We conclude that being mycorrhizal is important for the persistence of aliens in Germany and constitutes an advantage compared to being non-mycorrhizal. Being facultative mycorrhizal seems to be especially advantageous for successful spread, as the flexibility of this mycorrhizal status may enable plants to use a broader set of ecological strategies.

Chemical control of root rot complex and stem rot of greenhouse cucumber in straw-bale culture	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Greenhouse cucumbers; Fusarium root and stem rot; Associated soil-borne fungi; Disease control; Fungicides; Broad-spectrum mixture	SP RADICIS-CUCUMERINUM; RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; FUSARIUM-WILT; CROWN ROT; FUNGICIDES; SUPPRESSION; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE; FUNGAL; SEED	Experiments were conducted in three different commercial greenhouses wherein cucumber (Cucumis sativus L) cv. Kalunga F-1 (Long English type) were grown in composted straw bales, heavily infested with Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.:Fr. f.sp. radicis-cucumerinum Vakalounakis (FORC), the causal agent of Fusarium root and stem rot of cucumber. FORC was isolated from roots and stem bases of symptomatic plants either in single infections or simultaneously with other root infecting pathogens, including species of Phytophthora and Pythium and Rhizoctonia solani Kahn AG-4. Verticillium dahliae Kleb. was obtained from individual cucumber plants showing wilt symptoms. Fungicide applications started at the beginning of fruiting time when the first symptomatic plants occurred and followed at 45-day intervals. Three fungicides, either alone or as tank-mixed combinations of 0.1% Topsin M 70WP (thiophanate-methyl 700 g kg(-1)) plus 0.15% Previcur 607SL (607 g L-1 propamocarb hydrochloride), or 0.1% Benomyl 50WP (benomyl 50 g kg(-1)) plus 0.15% Previcur 607SL, were applied to the crown and root area of cucumber plants through drip irrigation systems as drenches at a rate of 0.25 L/plant. Plant mortality was reduced by 11.1%-84.8% and 23.8%-77.7% when plants were drenched with Topsin M 70WP in combination with Previcur 607SL or Benomyl 50WP plus Previcur 607SL, respectively. In comparison, significantly lower levels of disease control were achieved when these fungicides were applied individually. Three fungicide applications during the crop season increased the inhibitory effect of the fungicide regime on the disease incidence compared to one or two treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is little information on the effect of PGPR inoculation on the growth and nutrient accumulation of forest container seedlings. This study determined the effects of a growth medium inoculated with PGPR on the nutrient uptake, nutrient accumulation, and growth of Fraxinus americana container seedlings. PGPR inoculation with fertilizer increased the dry matter accumulation of the F. americana aerial parts with delayed seedling emergence time. Under fertilized conditions, the accumulation time of phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) in the F. americana aerial parts was 13 days longer due to PGPR inoculation. PGPR increased the maximum daily P and K accumulations in fertilized seedlings by 9.31 and 10.44 %, respectively, but had little impact on unfertilized ones. Regardless of fertilizer application, the root exudates, namely sugars, amino acids, and organic acids significantly increased because of PGPR inoculation. PGPR inoculation with fertilizer increased the root, shoot, and leaf yields by 19.65, 22.94, and 19.44 %, respectively, as well as the P and K contents by 8.33 and 10.60 %, respectively. Consequently, the N, P, and K uptakes increased by 19.85, 31.97, and 33.95 %, respectively. Hence, PGPR inoculation with fertilizer can be used as a bioenhancer for plant growth and nutrient uptake in forest container seedling nurseries.

The insect vector Cacopsylla picta vertically transmits the bacterium 'Candidatus Phytoplasma mali' to its progeny	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						apple proliferation; epidemiology; insect vectors; phytoplasma & relatives; psyllids; transovarial transmission	APPLE PROLIFERATION PHYTOPLASMA; TRANSOVARIAL TRANSMISSION; MELANONEURA HOMOPTERA; IDENTIFICATION; PSYLLIDAE; TRENTINO; COSTALIS; GERMANY; ADULTS; PLANTS	The phloem-sucking psyllid Cacopsylla picta plays an important role in transmitting the bacterium 'Candidatus Phytoplasma mali', the agent associated with apple proliferation disease. The psyllid can ingest 'Ca.Phytoplasma mali' from infected apple trees and spread the bacterium by subsequently feeding on uninfected trees. Until now, this has been the most important method of 'Ca.Phytoplasma mali' transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate whether infected C.picta are able to transmit 'Ca.Phytoplasma mali' directly to their progeny. This method of transmission would allow the bacteria to bypass a time-consuming reproductive cycle in the host plant. Furthermore, this would cause a high number of infected F-1 individuals in the vector population. To address this question, eggs, nymphs and adults derived from infected overwintering adults of C.picta were reared on non-infected apple saplings and subsequently tested for the presence of 'Ca.Phytoplasma mali'. In this study it was shown for the first time that infected C.picta individuals transmit 'Ca.Phytoplasma mali' to their eggs, nymphs and F-1 adults, thus providing the basis for a more detailed understanding of 'Ca.Phytoplasma mali' transmission by C. picta.

Using from natural antimicrobial essential oils is applied method to decrease the rate of microbial contamination of dairy products. The present investigation was done to study the antimicrobial effects of Z. raultiflora and 0. basilicam essential oils on survival of E. coli 0157:H7 during ripening of traditional Lighvan cheese. Methods: Leaves of the Z. ftlora and O. hasilicam plants were subjected to the Clevenger apparatus. Concentrations of 0, 100 and 200 ppm of the Z. inultiflora and 0, 50 and 100 ppm of O. basilican) essential oils and also 10' and 105 cfu/m1 numbers of E. ce/i 0157:117 were used. The numbers of the E. coil 0157:H7 bacteria were analyzed during the days 0, 30, 60 and 90 of the ripening period. Results: Z. multiflora and O. basilicum essential oils had considerable antimicrobial effects against E. cull 0157:117. Using the essential oils caused decrease in the numbers of E. en/i 0157:117 bacteria in 90th days of ripening (P <0.05). Using from Z. multillora at concentration of 200 ppm can reduce the survival of E. coil 0157:117 in Lighvan cheese. Conclusion: Using Z. multillora and O. basilicum essential oils as good antimicrobial agents can reduce the risk of foodborrie bacteria and especially E. coil 0157:117 in food products.

Stalk Rot Diseases Impact Sweet Sorghum Biofuel Traits	BIOENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						Sweet sorghum; Fusarium stalk rot; Charcoal rot; Biofuel feedstock; Bioethanol; Combining ability; Resistance; Tolerance	BICOLOR L. MOENCH; CELLULOSIC ETHANOL; GENETIC DIVERSITY; CHARCOAL ROT; RESISTANCE; FEEDSTOCK; DROUGHT; BIOMASS; ENERGY; MAIZE	Owing to its sugar-rich stalks and high biomass, sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] has potential as a source of biofuel feedstock for juice and lignocellulosic-based bioethanol production. However, stalk rot-mediated lodging is an important concern. The potential impacts of disease on sweet sorghum biofuel traits are currently unknown. The objectives of this study were to test the effects of Fusarium stalk rot and charcoal rot on sweet sorghum biofuel traits and to assess the combining ability of the parental genotypes for resistance to the two diseases. Nineteen genotypes including 7 parents and 12 hybrids were tested in the field in 2014 (Ashland, Kansas) and 2015 (Manhattan, Kansas) against Fusarium thapsinum (FT) and Macrophomina phaseolina (MP). Fourteen days after flowering, plants were inoculated with FT and MP. Plants were harvested at 35 days after inoculation and measured for disease severity using stalk lesion length. Grain weight, juice weight, Brix (A degrees Bx), and dried bagasse weight were also determined. Total soluble sugars per plant (TSSP) were determined using juice weight and A degrees Bx. On average, FT and MP resulted in reduced grain weight and dried bagasse weight by 17.4 and 17.6 %, respectively, across genotypes. Depending on the genotype, pathogens reduced juice weight, A degrees Bx, and TSSP in the ranges of 11.3 to 25.9, 0.2 to 16.7, and 21.2 to 33.3 %, respectively. Parental line general and specific combining abilities were found to be statistically insignificant. This study revealed the adverse effects of stalk rot diseases on harvestable biofuel traits and the need to breed sweet sorghum for stalk rot resistance.	[Bandara, Y. M. A. Y.; Little, C.

Interaction of fungicide physical modes of action and plant phenology in control of stem rust of perennial ryegrass grown for seed	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article						Lolium perenne	GERMINATION; DURATION; CROPS	Azoxystrobin provided protective and curative effects against stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis subsp. graminicola) of inoculated perennial ryegrass under field conditions, significantly reducing disease severity compared with the nontreated check when applied as much as 15 days before infection or 14 days after infection. Propiconazole had a significant effect when applied 13, but not 15, days before infection or 7, but not 9, days after infection. Either fungicide was very effective when applied near the time of infection, and the effectiveness of each fungicide was well described by a second- or third-order polynomial with time (days or stem rust latent periods) as the independent variable. When symptomatic plants were sprayed with a fungicide, subsequent urediniospore production per pustule was reduced by 73% in propiconazole-treated plants and by 95% in azoxystrobin-treated plants. Azoxystrobin modestly but significantly reduced germinability of urediniospores from sprayed pustules, unlike propiconazole. These differences between the two fungicides in physical modes of action resulted in a marked difference in their effects on secondary, within-plant spread of the disease. In normal disease development, sporulation from the inner (adaxial) face of pustules on the flag-leaf sheath produces inoculum that leads to numerous contiguous secondary infections along the length of the emerging inflorescence, but only 7% of azoxystrobin-treated sheath pustules had sporulation from the adaxial surface compared with 72 and 90% of propiconazole-treated and nontreated pustules, respectively. Tillers treated with propiconazole early in the process of within-plant spread had significantly greater final stem rust severity than those treated with azoxystrobin at this time. Results of these experiments will allow effects of fungicide application to be incorporated into quantitative epidemic models that describe disease development as a function of environment and plant phenology.

In the absence of sexual reproductive structures and with asexual spore morphology conserved since the Ordovician, Glomeromycota may be one of the oldest eukaryotic lineages that rely predominantly on asexual reproduction for gene transmission. Clonal population structure detected in the majority of AM fungi examined to date supports this hypothesis. However, evidence of recombination found in few local populations suggests that genetic exchanges may be more common in these organisms than is currently recognized. To explore the significance of clonal expansion versus genetic recombination in the life history of modern Glomeromycota, we examined the global population of a cosmopolitan fungus Glomus etunicatum and made inferences about the population structure and the occurrence of recombination in the history of this species. We sampled eight loci from 84 isolates. We found that although the global population of G. etunicatum showed a pattern of significant differentiation, several haplotypes had a broad geographic distribution spanning multiple continents. Molecular variation among the sampled isolates indicated an overwhelmingly clonal population structure and suggested that clonal expansion plays an important role in the ecological success of modern Glomeromycota. In contrast, a pattern of homoplasy consistent with a history of recombination suggested that gene exchanges are not completely absent from the life history of these organisms, although they are likely to be very rare.

Life history determines biogeographical patterns of soil bacterial communities over multiple spatial scales	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						bacteria; biogeography; soil; species-area relationships	16S RIBOSOMAL-RNA; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE	The extent to which the distribution of soil bacteria is controlled by local environment vs. spatial factors (e.g. dispersal, colonization limitation, evolutionary events) is poorly understood and widely debated. Our understanding of biogeographic controls in microbial communities is likely hampered by the enormous environmental variability encountered across spatial scales and the broad diversity of microbial life histories. Here, we constrained environmental factors (soil chemistry, climate, above-ground plant community) to investigate the specific influence of space, by fitting all other variables first, on bacterial communities in soils over distances from m to 102 km. We found strong evidence for a spatial component to bacterial community structure that varies with scale and organism life history (dispersal and survival ability). Geographic distance had no influence over community structure for organisms known to have survival stages, but the converse was true for organisms thought to be less hardy. Community function (substrate utilization) was also shown to be highly correlated with community structure, but not to abiotic factors, suggesting nonstochastic determinants of community structure are important Our results support the view that bacterial soil communities are constrained by both edaphic factors and geographic distance and further show that the relative importance of such constraints depends critically on the taxonomic resolution used to evaluate spatio-temporal patterns of microbial diversity, as well as life history of the groups being investigated, much as is the case for macro-organisms.

That island characteristics, including remoteness, can profoundly modulate biological diversity has been borne out by studies of animals and plants. By contrast, the processes influencing microbial diversity in island systems remain largely undetermined. We sequenced arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal DNA from plant roots collected on 13 islands worldwide and compared AM fungal diversity on islands with existing data from mainland sites. AM fungal communities on islands (even those >6000 km from the closest mainland) comprised few endemic taxa and were as diverse as mainland communities. Thus, in contrast to patterns recorded among macro-organisms, efficient dispersal appears to outweigh the effects of taxogenesis and extinction in regulating AM fungal diversity on islands. Nonetheless, AM fungal communities on more distant islands comprised a higher proportion of previously cultured and large-spored taxa, indicating that dispersal may be human-mediated or require tolerance of significant environmental stress, such as exposure to sunlight or high salinity. The processes driving large-scale patterns of microbial diversity are a key consideration for attempts to conserve and restore functioning ecosystems in this era of rapid global change.

In contrast to sampling of abiotic components trace element concentrations of plant materials are strongly dependent on plant age, organ and tissue function, genotypic character of uptake, translocation and allocation, and are modified by the impact of other organisms. The consequences of these dynamic processes are considerable differences in element matrices. After the identification of the individual in the field the aim of the investigation will decide on the plant part(s) to be sampled, either at random or selectively. The most frequently taken plant parts in space and time are the leaves, either deciduous or evergreen. Leaf age, their position and insertion on the plant, their longevity, infestations by pathogens, injury by herbivores, and exposure to atmospheric components determine the element concentration; therefore a rigid sampling protocol is necessary. Due to their different chemical compositions, twigs and stems have to be separated into bark inclusive of phloem and wood. Exposure to precipitation and colonisation by epiphytes and bark decomposers have to be noted. In the case of roots, many chemical elements are only adsorbed to the root cell walls and are not, or only to very low degree, translocated to the other root cell components and from roots to shoots. In addition to high fragility of fine roots and root hairs and their strong association with soil particles and soil organic matter, roots of most plant species have an intimate symbiotic association with mycorrhizal fungi. The change in the degree of infestation with endomycorrhizal fungi during one growing season and the change of ectomycorrhizal partners during life history are important aspects of sampling for monitoring purposes. The great variation of rooting depth during ontogeny, dependent on soil conditions, requires control of this parameter in the field. A protocol for random and selected sampling will be presented.

Roots were analyzed by AMF-specific nested polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism screening, and sequence analyses of rDNA small subunit and internal transcribed spacer regions. The AMF sequences were analyzed phylogenetically and used to define monophyletic phylotypes. Overall, 16 phylotypes from several lineages of AMF were detected. The community composition was strongly influenced by the experimental approach, with additional influence of cultivation duration, substrate, and host plant species in some experiments. Some fungal phylotypes, e.g., GLOM-A3 (Glomus mosseae) and several members of Glomus group B, appeared predominantly in the greenhouse experiment or in bait plants. Thus, these phylotypes can be considered r strategists, rapidly colonizing uncolonized ruderal habitats in early successional stages of the fungal community. In the greenhouse experiment, for instance, G. mosseae was abundant after 3 months, but could not be detected anymore after 10 months. In contrast, other phylotypes as GLOM-A17 (G. badium) and GLOM-A16 were detected almost exclusively in roots sampled from plants naturally growing in the grassland or from bait plants exposed in the field, indicating that they preferentially occur in late successional stages of fungal communities and thus represent the K strategy. The only phylotype found with high frequency in all three experimental approaches was GLOM A-1 (G. intraradices), which is known to be a generalist. These results indicate that, in greenhouse trap experiments, it is difficult to establish a root-colonizing AMF community reflecting the diversity of these fungi in the field roots because fungal succession in such artificial systems may bias the results. However, the field bait plant approach might be a convenient way to study the influence of different environmental factors on AMF community composition directly under the field conditions. For a better understanding of the dynamics of AMF communities, it will be necessary to classify AMF phylotypes and species according to their life history strategies.

Trade-offs in pathogens are of particular interest because they may constrain the evolution and epidemiology of diseases. Here, studies that have measured life-history trade-offs in pathogens (fungi, oomycetes and viruses) of agricultural crops, as well as pathogens attacking wild host plants, are reviewed. The majority of studies report a penalty associated with high virulence as is evidenced by lower performance during subsequent life-history stages. However, costs are not pervasive, and the strength and even shape of life-history correlations can vary according to host genotype, and abiotic environment. Importantly, life-history trade-offs are shown to have profound epidemiological implications ranging from lower disease prevalence of strains harbouring unnecessary virulence, to increased extinction risk at the metapopulation level. From an evolutionary perspective, costs of virulence are shown to constrain the range of R genes, and hence host genotypes, a given strain can adapt to. Moreover, costs of virulence play an important role in limiting the host range of pathogens. Hence, analysis of pathogen life history plays a key role in identifying means of battling disease, from breeding durable resistance to epidemiological intervention strategies.

Detection of pathogen from infected plant parts and seeds is important to eliminate pathogen from disease cycle. For detection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae from natural infected leaves and stored seeds, a polymerase chain reaction technique using hrp gene (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) sequence of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae based primers DXoo_hrp1F (5'-GGACCCTCCGGTTCTGAG-3') and DXoo_hrp1R (5'-CTGCAGGCATTGCTTAAAGA-3') were used to amplify at 384 bp DNA fragment. The specificity of the primer was tested with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae along with other Xanthomonas species such as Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. punicae and Ralstonia solanacearum. It amplified only DNA fragment of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae at 384 bp. The developed set of primer was highly sensitive and detected 2.6 x 10(2) cfu/ml of bacteria. The Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae was detected from naturally infected leaves of rice collected from the bacterial ooze as DNA template through conventional - PCR. To detect Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae from seeds, the bacterial culture was artificially inoculated on rice cv. Pusa Basmati 1 plant at flowering time and the matured seeds were harvested and stored for 8 months under ambient conditions. The bacterium was detected from seeds after 8 months of storage even 2 seeds/ml, when DNA of bacterium was extracted by short cut methods adding 95% ethanol through BIO-PCR. This method is reliable, more sensitive than conventional-PCR and may detect Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae within 2 days from the seeds and other planting materials.

Plantlets, cultured under commercial nursery conditions, were treated twice with bacteria after transplanting from in vitro conditions. Bacterial application was performed by drenching bacterial suspension containing approximately 10(8) CFU (colony-forming units) g(-1) of substrate. Both strains significantly increased aerial fresh weight, plant length and leaf area, while the effect on other growth parameters depended on the strain. N content was also significantly increased after both bacteria treatments. A second experiment was performed to determine the potential biocontrol effect against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. Following the same experimental conditions, Meloidogyne inoculum containing 10 500 nematodes was applied 15 days after the second bacteria treatment. At the end of the experiment, 135 days later, nematode reproduction in roots of bacterised bananas was significantly reduced. In both experiments, the inoculated bacteria colonised the root system and population levels in root, 5.5 months after transplanting were 6.8 x 10(3) to 1.6 x 10(4) CFU g(-1) fresh weight of root. The potential use of this technology to improve hardening stages in banana plant production in commercial nurseries is discussed.	[Rodriguez-Romero, A. S.; Jaizme-Vega, M.

Two experiments were conducted in a greenhouse to evaluate the effect of Mo-enriched seeds, obtained from plants treated with foliar fertilization, on growth and N accumulation by common bean plants. The soil substrate was the A horizon of a Haplustult (3.5 kg pots), which were limed and fully fertilized with exception of Mo. The first experiment had a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial design with five replications: three bean cultivars, two seed Mo concentrations, and two harvest dates. In plants of the three cultivars originating from seeds with high Mo concentration, the shoot biomass and N accumulation were higher at both harvests. Seeds with high Mo concentration increased the nodule mass of cultivars Manteigao and Rio Tibagi 30 days after emergence (DAE) but reduced biomass and number of nodules in the cultivars Carioca and Manteigao 45 DAE. High seed Mo concentration increased the nitrogenase activity 30 DAE and the specific nitrogenase activity 45 DAE. The second experiment had a 2 x 2 x 4 factorial design with five replications: two bean cultivars, two seed Mo concentrations, and four harvest dates. The shoot mass in plants originating from seeds with high Mo concentration was higher 47 and 59 DAE, and shoot N accumulation was higher 59 DAT. High seed Mo concentration did not affect nodulation until 45 DAE, but reduced nodule number 59 DAE. The reduced nodulation at the pod filling stage observed in both experiments, in plants grown from seeds with high Mo concentration, can be due to the improved growth of these plants, which may have anticipated the translocation of assimilates to pods. It can be concluded that Mo-enriched seeds, harvested from plants treated with foliar fertilizer, can stimulate nitrogenase activity and increase biomass and N accumulation in common bean plants.

The fungi belonged to eight groups, six dematiaceous genera (Alternaria, Cladosporium, Chaetomium, Curvularia, Drechslera and Scopulariopsis) and the non-dematiaceous genera Acremonium, Aspergillus, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Paecilomyces and Penicillium along with some Mycelia sterilia.. There were qualitative and quantitative differences in the type and number of isolates obtained from greenhouse and field-grown plants, with more isolates being obtained from the latter. No difference was found in the number of fungi isolated from leaves and steins irrespective of where the plants was grown. For was field-grown plants, the number of isolates decreased as the plants aged and more fungi were found in tissues near the soil, while for greenhouse-grown plants the number of isolates increased as the plants aged but in this case no more fungi were isolated from those tissues nearer the soil.

Plants in sterile culture were subjected to salt influence (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0% NaCl) from the moment of their planting, whereas in the case of water culture 0.4% NaCl was introduced 14 days after seed germination. Decline of total nodule mass was observed in both cases, such decline being proportional to the harmful influence of salt on growth of the host plant. A salt concentration of 0.7% was the threshold concentration for alfalfa growth and the process of nodule formation. Decline of total nodule mass was mainly determined by suppression of processes involved in the laying-down of nodules (decrease in the number of nodules formed on the plant). Nodule growth was insignificantly suppressed under conditions of salinity. The nitrogen-fixing activity of nodules formed under conditions of salinity (0.4% NaCl) was two to four times lower than in nodules of the control variant (fresh medium). Decrease in the nitrogen-fixing activity of nodules under conditions of salinity of the medium was accompanied by accelerated degradation of symbiosomes in cells of their central tissue.

Using a natural C-13 tracer method to separately measure SOM-derived CO2 from root-derived CO2, this study aims to connect the level of rhizosphere-dependent SOM decomposition with the C and N balance of the whole plant-soil system, and to mechanistically link the rhizosphere priming effect to soil microbial turnover and evapotranspiration. Results indicated that the magnitude of the rhizosphere priming effect on SOM decomposition varied widely, from zero to more than 380% of the unplanted control, and was largely influenced by plant species and phenology. Balancing the extra soil C loss from the strong rhizosphere priming effect in the planted treatments with C inputs from rhizodeposits and root biomass, the whole plant-soil system remained with a net carbon gain at the end of the experiment. The increased soil microbial biomass turnover rate and the enhanced evapotranspiration rate in the planted treatments had clear positive relationships with the level of the rhizosphere priming effect. The rhizosphere enhancement of soil carbon mineralization in the planted treatments did not result in a proportional increase in net N mineralization, suggesting a possible decoupling of C cycling with N cycling in the rhizosphere.

(biserrula) and Ornithopus compressus L. (yellow serradella) and associated rhizobia was studied using germplasm collected from sites in central-eastern and south-eastern Sardinia (Italy). Pods and root-nodule bacteria were collected on diagonal transects at each site. Plants were characterised in nursery rows and the rhizobia were isolated and tested for their effectiveness. Thirteen morphological traits were recorded and the results were analysed using cluster analysis. Genetic and phenotypic variation of rhizobia were assessed using DNA analysis (PCR, RAPDs) and effectiveness indices, respectively. Genetic variation based on morphological traits was found between and within sites for both species. Pod characteristics and flowering time were the most important traits assisting in discriminating between accessions. Flowering time varied more in serradella than in biserrula, particularly at Cantoniera Cannas. Although all rhizobial strains nodulated all accessions of biserrula, great variability in capacity to fix nitrogen was evident between and within sites. Distinct PCR amplification profiles were generated for individual rhizobial strains, which confirmed the phenotypic variability (effectiveness indices) of the strains. No relationship was found between host and rhizobia variation. The results are discussed in terms of (a) genetic differences for each species within and between sites; (b) differences in behaviour in respect to genetic variation between biserrula, serradella, and other Mediterranean annual legumes; and (c) spatial variability and symbiotic effectiveness of rhizobia.

Growth of B japonicum strain E109 was not affected by this herbicide even when exposed to concentrations 150 times higher than recommended field doses. However, nodulation of soybean plants treated 5 days after emergence with chlorimuron-ethyl at standard application rates was impaired: a 38% decrease in the number of nodules per plant was observed four weeks after treatment. Despite nodule number decrease, no changes in shoot nitrogen content could be detected. Total fresh biomass was diminished by 25% in herbicide-treated plants. Leghemoglobin content in nodules did not vary; nevertheless total nodule protein was diminished by 40% in the herbicide-treated group. ALS activity in different soybean tissues and their relative sensitivity to chlorimuron-ethyl were also investigated. Roots and bacteroids had the greatest specific ALS activities. On a fresh weight basis, the bacteroid fraction displayed the highest ALS activity and was also the most tolerant to in vitro chlorimuron addition: 72% of its activity was retained after including 10 mu M chlorimuron-ethyl in the reaction mixture. These results indicate that standard application rates of chlorimuron-ethyl will have limited incidence on B japonicum survival, and effects on nodulation may have little long-term consequences on soybean nitrogen fixation potential. The differences found among soybean tissues not only in intrinsic ALS activity but also in their relative sensitivity to this herbicide suggests that, in leguminous plants living in symbiosis with rhizobia, nodules may contribute to an enhanced tolerance to ALS inhibitors.

In this study, we used 165 rRNA amplicon sequencing and metagenomics to investigate the assembly of bacterial populations in a full-scale municipal activated sludge wastewater treatment plant over a period of 3 years, including a 9-month period of disturbance characterized by short-term plant shutdowns. Following the reconstruction of 173 metagenome-assembled genomes, we assessed the functional potential, the number of rRNA gene operons, and the in situ growth rate of microorganisms present throughout the time series. Operational disturbances caused a significant decrease in bacteria with a single copy of the rRNA (rrn) operon. Despite moderate differences in resource availability, replication rates were distributed uniformly throughout time, with no differences between disturbed and stable periods. We suggest that the length of the growth lag phase, rather than the growth rate, is the primary driver of selection under disturbed conditions. Thus, the system could maintain its function in the face of disturbance by recruiting bacteria with the capacity to rapidly resume growth under unsteady operating conditions. IMPORTANCE Disturbance is a key determinant of community assembly and dynamics in natural and engineered ecosystems. Microbiome response to disturbance is thought to be influenced by bacterial growth traits and life history strategies. In this time series observational study, the response to disturbance of microbial communities in a full-scale activated sludge wastewater treatment plant was assessed by computing specific cellular traits of genomes retrieved from metagenomes. It was found that the genomes observed in disturbed periods have more copies of the rRNA operon than genomes observed in stable periods, whereas the in situ mean relative growth rates of bacteria present during stable and disturbed periods were indistinguishable. From these intriguing observations, we infer that the length of the lag phase might be a growth trait that affects the microbial response to disturbance. Further exploration of this hypothesis could contribute to better understanding of the adaptive response of microbiomes to unsteady environmental conditions.

However, there are several factors responsible for low productivity of crops. Among these stands out the occurrence of associated virus culture. Thus, this study aimed to assess the damage and symptoms of PRSV-W, CMV, ZYMV and WMV inoculated at 5, 12 and 19 days after emergence (DAE). According to the results, PRSV-W viruses, CMV, ZYMV and WMV influenced significantly (p < 0.05) reduction in the fresh weight of shoots and on pulp and reduction of fruit weight of inoculated plants. As noted on pulp plants inoculated with PRSV-W, at 5 DAE. With regard to the soluble solids content (degrees Brix) was dramatically reduced by the virus and inoculation period, in this case being more significant fruits of plants inoculated with CMV presented Brix 3.67 to 5.11 depending on the inoculation period. In general, viruses PRSV-W, WMV, CMV, ZYMV and influence the development and consequently the production of watermelon. Thus, an important factor for the reduction in the quality of fruit produced.

We related the molecular composition of compost of different maturity added to soils to their effects on maize growth, N and P uptake, AMF root colonization and growth, and composition of soil microbial community. The characteristics of compost after different days of maturation (C60, C90, C120) were provided by C-13-solid state NMR spectroscopy, while neutral (NLFA) and phospholipid (PLFA) fatty acid analyses were used to evaluate the effects of compost on the composition of soil microbial communities. Multivariate elaboration was used to determine the relationships between microbial groups, as identified by PLFA analysis, and molecular properties of composts. Although compost amendments increased soil total C and N, and available P, soil addition of both C60 and C120 compost samples was detrimental to plant and AMF growth. Compost amendments modified the composition of soil microbial communities. The high content of biolabile compounds in C60 and C120 compost samples decreased the C16:1 omega 5 NLFA that was related to AMF and Gram(+)/Gram(-) and AMF/saprotrophic fungi ratios. A linear correlation was found between the molecular indexes in compost and the microbial groups in soil, thereby suggesting that the molecular composition of compost strictly controls the development and abundance of soil microbial communities. These findings highlight the importance of controlling the molecular quality of recycled biomass added to soil, in order to predict the effect on crop yields and biotic composition of soil.

Plant community phenology and life span also affect soil resources by determining the timing and quantity of plant nutrient uptake, storage, and release. Using the replacement of C-3-C-4 perennial grasses by the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum as a case study, we investigated the influence of phenology and life span on pulse responses and sizes of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools. We hypothesized that available and microbial C and N would respond to small rainfall events and that B. tectorum invasion would increase soil C and N pools by reducing inter-annual plant C and N storage and alter seasonal pool dynamics by changing the timing of plant uptake and litter inputs. We tested our hypotheses by simulating small rainfall events in B. tectorum and perennial grass communities three times during the growing season. Microbial pools responded strongly to soil moisture and simulated rainfall events, but labile C and N pools were affected weakly or not at all. All pools were larger beneath B. tectorum than perennial grasses. Soil C and N pools increased after senescence in both communities. Our results suggest that transforming a perennial into a B. tectorum dominated community increases the overall size of soil C and N pools by decreasing plant C and N storage and changes seasonal pool dynamics by altering dominant plant phenology. Our results indicate strong roles for water, life span and phenology in controlling soil C and N pools and begin to elucidate the biogeochemical effects of altering plant community phenology and life span.

Although they lack an adaptive immune system, insects possess an innate immune system that recognizes and destroys intruding microorganisms. Its operation under natural conditions has not been well studied, as most studies have introduced microbes to laboratory-reared insects via artificial mechanical wounding. One of the most common routes of natural exposure and infection, however, is via food; thus, the role of dietary microbial communities in herbivorous insect immune system evolution invites study. Here, we examine the immune system response and consequences of exposing a lepidopteran agricultural pest to non-infectious microorganisms via simple oral consumption. Results: Immune system response was compared between Trichoplusia ni larvae reared on diets with or without non-pathogenic bacteria ( Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus). Two major immune response-related enzymatic activities responded to diets differently - phenoloxidase activity was inhibited in the bacteria-fed larvae, whereas general antibacterial activity was enhanced. Eight proteins were highly expressed in the hemolymph of the bacteria fed larvae, among them immune response related proteins arylphorin, apolipophorin III and gloverin. Expression response among 25 putative immune response-related genes were assayed via RT-qPCR. Seven showed more than fivefold up regulation in the presence of bacterial diet, with 22 in total being differentially expressed, among them apolipophorin III, cecropin, gallerimycin, gloverin, lysozyme, and phenoloxidase inhibiting enzyme. Finally, potential life-history trade-offs were studied, with pupation time and pupal mass being negatively affected in bacteria fed larvae. Conclusion: The presence of bacteria in food, even if non-pathogenic, can trigger an immune response cascade with life history tradeoffs. Trichoplusia ni larvae are able to detect and respond to environmental microbes encountered in the diet, possibly even using midgut epithelial tissue as a sensing organ. Potential benefits of this immune system priming may outweigh the observed tradeoffs, as priming based on environmentally sensed bacterial may decrease risk of serious infection. These results show that food plant microbial communities represent a dynamic and unstudied part of the coevolutionary interactions between plants and their insect herbivores.

However, there are other rhizobia and bradyrhizobia species that nodulate some tropical leguminous trees and can fix N2 at high temperatures. In a trial of rhizobial strains isolated from leguminous trees, we found that 14 out of 21 isolates from Gliricidia, Lonchocarpus and Leucaena were also able to nodulate common beans at optimal temperatures (28/23-degrees-C, day/night). When we exposed beans inoculated with these strains to high temperature conditions, 40-degrees-C/8 h/day, some of them accumulated at flowering time as much or more N as bean plants receiving mineral N. These broad host-range sources of rhizobia capable of fixing nitrogen with bean at high temperature seem to have the potential to improve yields in tropical soils.

Two wooden vats were activated with deproteinized whey in a dairy pilot plant. One vat was used for control production and one for experimental production performed after a massive contamination of milk with a multi-strain combination of E. coli O157. Cheese making processes were monitored from wooden vats surface to ripened cheese by performing microbiological and chemico-physical analysis. The results of pH, activity water (a(w)) and LAB concentration showed similar trends in both productions. In particular, pH and a(w) decreased during the production and ripening while LAB count increased. The specific investigation of E. coli O157 in experimental production showed the inability of this pathogen to adhere and survive on wooden vat biofilms: this may be due to the acidity and the bacteriocin generated by LAB that represented efficient barriers to their adhesion. The level of E. coli O157 in cheese decreased progressively but their presence was detected up to 90 days of ripening showing the ability of this bacteria to survive at low values of pH (5.20) and a(w) (0.920). Escherichia coli O157 was never detected at 120 days of ripening. These results confirmed that the ripening and the synergistic effect among acid condition generated by LAB and the low a(w) are able to delete this pathogen from raw ewes' milk cheeses.

Age-Related Resistance to Phytophthora Fruit Rot in 'Dickenson Field' Processing Pumpkin and 'Golden Delicious' Winter Squash Fruit	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							PEPPER PLANTS; CAPSICI; TEMPERATURE	Meyer, M. D., and Hausbeck, M. K. 2013. Age-related resistance to Phytophthora fruit rot in 'Dickenson Field' processing pumpkin and 'Golden Delicious' winter squash fruit. Plant Dis. 97:446-452. Phytophthora fruit rot, caused by Phytophthora capsici, is a major constraint to cucurbit production for the processing industry in Michigan. Age-related resistance to Phytophthora fruit rot has been identified in pepper and some cucurbit fruit. In this study, 'Dickenson Field' processing pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) and 'Golden Delicious' winter squash (C. maxima) were evaluated for age-related resistance to Phytophthora fruit rot. Hand-pollinated fruit were harvested 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 42, or 56 days post pollination (dpp), and inoculated with P. capsici isolate 12889. Susceptibility to Phytophthora fruit rot decreased with fruit age in Dickenson Field processing pumpkin, whereas Golden Delicious winter squash remained susceptible to fruit rot even as fruit reached full physiological maturity. Less than 15% of Dickenson Field fruit 21 dpp or older became diseased. Conversely, about 80% of Golden Delicious fruit 21 dpp or older became diseased. Lesion diameter and pathogen growth density ratings differed significantly (P < 0.0001) among fruit ages for both cultivars, and were negatively correlated (rho = 0.37 to 0.87) with fruit age. Lesion diameter and pathogen growth were generally greater on younger fruit than older fruit. Lesion diameter was greatest on 7- and 10-dpp-old fruit of Dickenson Field and Golden Delicious, respectively. Pathogen growth density ratings were greatest on 3-dpp-old fruit of both cultivars. Several morphological and physiological changes were observed as fruit matured. Soluble solids content and exocarp firmness of both cultivars increased with fruit age. Lesion diameter and pathogen growth density ratings were negatively correlated (rho = -0.29 to -0.73) with soluble solids content and exocarp firmness.	[Meyer, M. D.; Hausbeck, M.

This has long been thought to be related to the predominantly or seasonally dry climate. The present study posits that if aridity were a key factor in the evolution of sequestrate fruit-bodies, most sequestrate species would have emerged in Australia only after it began to aridify, which occurred post-separation with Antarctica (c. 32 million years ago). Focusing on the high phylogenetic diversity of sequestrate taxa in the Agaricomycetes in Australia, dates of sequestrate nodes were compiled directly from published phylogenies (four lineages) or created using sequences available on GenBank that were processed in BEAST using a secondary calibration method (nine lineages). Although the morphologically diverse Hysterangiales was found to be the first group to become sequestrate, c. 83 million years ago, overall sequestration in Australia occurred more recently. Models were created and compared and support was found for an increased rate of sequestration in Australia at some point between 34 and 13 million years ago (during the Oligocene and Miocene). Although the rate of sequestration is shown to have increased in Australia after separation from Antarctica, the timing also overlaps with the radiation of potential mycorrhizal plant associates, and the emergence of specialised mycophagous marsupials. Although aridification is evidently not the sole driver of sequestration, it is still likely to have had a major influence on the diversity of sequestrate fungi in Australia. Comparisons with other regions of high sequestrate diversity will be informative.

Genetic Diversity and Symbiotic Effectiveness Assessment of Two Agricultural Soils of Brazilian Drylands	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article						Biological nitrogen fixation; Microvirga; Bradyrhizobium; Brazilian semiarid region; Inoculants	BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN-FIXATION; SEMIARID REGION; SP NOV.; PYROGENIC CARBON; ROOT-NODULES; RHIZOBIA; YIELD; PERFORMANCE; LEGUMINOSAE; EFFICIENCY	The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of biochar amendment on the bacterial genetic diversity and symbiosis in cowpea-nodulating rhizobial communities in two agricultural soils of Brazilian drylands. Vertisol and Ultisol surface layer soil samples were collected in the Brazilian semiarid region. The soils were mixed with biochar and cowpea seeds (BRS Marataoa) and sown in pots. Forty-five days after plant emergence, the nodule bacteria were isolated. The genetic variability of the nodule bacteria was evaluated by means of restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (IGS-RFLP), and those that shared identical IGS-RFLP profiles were fingerprinted by BOX-PCR. By selecting of representative isolates in the genetic clusters, 27 bacteria were identified by 16S-23S IGS sequencing and symbiotically assessed. The IGS-RFLP dendrogram of the 73 isolates had 20 clusters; the multivariate correspondence analysis grouped both Vertisol treatments, and the Ultisol treatments were placed far away in the biplot. Ultisol showed higher bradyrhizobial diversity than the Vertisol. The fingerprinting indicated the presence of only three clonal colonies, showing high intraspecific diversity. The 16S-23S IGS sequences indicated the prevalence of bacteria related to Bradyrhizobium guangxiense in the Vertisol and Bradyrhizobium zhanjiangense in the Ultisol, in addition to the presence of three putative Microvirga spp. in the Ultisol. The symbiotic efficiency of 22 out of 27 bacteria was comparable with that of the inoculant strain Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense BR 3267. The genetic diversity of the cowpea-nodulating bradyrhizobia was not primarily affected by the biochar application in two agricultural soils of Brazilian drylands. Both soils harbored symbiotically efficient bacteria, without the influence of biochar amendment .

Despite this ecological versatility, not much is known about the genetic diversity of this fungal species across different habitats or over large geographic scales. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach for the mitochondrial rRNA large subunit gene (mtLSU), distinguished different haplotypes among cultivated isolates of G. intraradices and within mycorrhizal root samples from the field. From analysis of 16 isolates of this species originating from five continents, 12 mitochondrial haplotypes were distinguished. Five additional mtLSU haplotypes were detected in field-collected mycorrhizal roots. Some introns in the mtLSU region appear to be stable over years of cultivation and are ancestral to the G. intraradices clade. Genetic diversity within G. intraradices is substantially higher than previously thought, although some mtLSU haplotypes are widespread. A restriction fragment length polymorphism approach also was developed to distinguish mtLSU haplotypes without sequencing. Using this molecular tool, intraspecific genetic variation of an AMF species can be studied directly in field plants.

As a result, the role of hyphal interactions in the establishment and maintenance of common mycorrhizal networks is poorly understood because of constraints on methods for in situ analysis. We designed a rhizohyphatron that allows the examination of intact mycelia growing from whole mycorrhizal plants. Plants preinoculated with spores were cultivated in a compartment with a connecting tube from which hyphae extend through a fine nylon mesh onto agar-coated slides. Species selected from each of the five AMF genera were used to assess and characterize the anastomosis behavior in the rhizohyphatron. Hyphal networks of Paraglomus occultum, Ambispora leptoticha, Scutellospora heterogama, and Gigaspora gigantea growing on the agar-coated slides showed no evidence of hyphal fusion. In contrast, anastomosis occurred in the hyphal networks of Glomus clarum and Glomus intraradices at an average frequency of less than 15% for both species. The rhizohyphatron developed in this study will provide knowledge of the biology and genetics of self/non-self recognition in AMF and help to better understand Glomeromycotan life history strategies.

Tannery sludge increased soil pH and organic matter, calcium and sodium content. There was an increase in soil salinity with application of the residue. There was also an increase in the dry matter yield of cowpea with tannery sludge addition, however, in higher rates, the residue decreased the Bradyrhizobium sp nodulation.

The most often investigated mechanisms mediating coexistence of these species are environmental filtering and niche partitioning. However, the role of other factors, such as species-specific parasites, is still poorly understood. Along the riparian understory of a tropical forest, we explored niche occupation and coexistence between Chrysso intervales and Helvibis longicauda, two related syntopic web-building spiders. We also investigated the effect of H. longicauda mortality induced by a specific fungus parasite, Gibellula pulchra, on the dynamic of C. intervales spatial distribution. Coexistence was mediated mainly by a fine-scale horizontal spatial segregation. H. longicauda built webs almost exclusively close to the river, while C. intervales occupied adjacent areas (10-20 m away from margins). We also found differentiation in other niche dimensions that might allow coexistence, such as in plants occupied, height of web placement, width of leaves used for thread attachment and phenology. H. longicauda mortality caused by fungi was higher during winter than in summer. Consequently, the abundance of C. intervales increased at distances close to the river, indicating competitive release through a density-mediated indirect effect. This demonstrates how non-competitive specific-antagonists can indirectly affect other non-hosts competing community members and influence their spatial distribution in fine-scale ranges. We suggest that environmental filtering restricts H. longicauda to cooler regions; niche partitioning leads populations to occupy different vertical strata and competitive exclusion precludes C. intervales to reach river margins, generating an unusual horizontal zonation pattern.

Important but lower yielding maize growing regions such as the sub-tropics experience unique challenges, the greatest of which are drought stress and aflatoxin contamination. Here we used a diversity panel consisting of 346 maize inbred lines originating in temperate, sub-tropical and tropical areas testcrossed to stiff-stalk line Tx714 to investigate these traits. Testcross hybrids were evaluated under irrigated and non-irrigated trials for yield, plant height, ear height, days to anthesis, days to silking and other agronomic traits. Irrigated trials were also inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and evaluated for aflatoxin content. Diverse maize testcrosses out-yielded commercial checks in most trials, which indicated the potential for genetic diversity to improve sub-tropical breeding programs. To identify genomic regions associated with yield, aflatoxin resistance and other important agronomic traits, a genome wide association analysis was performed. Using 60,000 SNPs, this study found 10 quantitative trait variants for grain yield, plant and ear height, and flowering time after stringent multiple test corrections, and after fitting different models. Three of these variants explained 5-10% of the variation in grain yield under both water conditions. Multiple identified SNPs co-localized with previously reported QTL, which narrows the possible location of causal polymorphisms. Novel significant SNPs were also identified. This study demonstrated the potential to use genome wide association studies to identify major variants of quantitative and complex traits such as yield under drought that are still segregating between elite inbred lines.

Selenium (Se) is an important microelement due to its antioxidant properties that allows detoxifying various reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, the effect of a foliar treatment of Se prior to fruit development on the subsequent postharvest decay and quality of tomato fruits was investigated. Foliar treatment of 1 mg L-1 sodium selenate at the time of fruit onset and development effectively controlled gray mold rot caused by Botrytis cinerea on both inoculated and naturally infected tomato fruit. Se treatment reduced lipid peroxidation, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity of glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, and increased the concentration of non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced ascorbate and reduced glutathione in the tomato fruits. Se also contributed to the maintenance of fruit quality during storage. The results suggested that Se stimulated the antioxidant defense system in tomato plants, thus making the fruits more resistant to postharvest decay caused by gray mold. Selenium treatment represents a promising strategy for managing postharvest decay and maintaining the quality of tomato fruits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this research was to identify the location of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in 'Conrad', a soybean cultivar with broad tolerance to many races of P. sojae. A PRR susceptible breeding line 'OX760-6-1' was crossed with Conrad. Through single-seed-descent, 112, F-2 derived, F-7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were advanced. A total of 39 random amplified polymorphic DNA bands (RAPDs) and 89 type 1 microsatellite (simple sequence repeat; SSR) markers were used to construct a genetic linkage map. In the greenhouse, RILs were inoculated with four P. sojae isolates (three from China and one from Canada). Disease was measured as the percent of dead plants 20 days after germination in P. sojae inoculated vermiculite in the greenhouse. Three QTLs (QGP1, QGP2, QGP3) for PRR tolerance in the greenhouse were detected using WinQTLCart 2.0 with a log-likelihood (LOD) score 27.14 acquired through permutations (1,000 at P <= 0.05). QGP1 (near Satt509) was located at linkage group F and explained 13.2%, 5.9%, and 6.7% of the phenotypic variance for tolerance to the JiXi, JianSanJiang and ShuangYaShan isolates, respectively. QGP2 (near Satt334) was located in a different interval on linkage group F and explained 5.1% and 2.4% of the phenotypic variance for JiXi and ShuangYaShan isolates, respectively. QGP3 was located on linkage group D1b + W (near OPL18(800)/SCL18(659)) and explained 10.2% of the phenotypic variance for Woodslee isolate. QGP1 and QGP2 appeared to be associated with PRR tolerance across a range of isolates but QGP3 was active only against the Woodslee isolate. At Woodslee and Weaver (in Ontario) in 2000, the interval associated with QGP3 explained 21.6% and 16.7% of phenotypic variance in resistance to PRR, respectively and was referred as QFP1. The identified QTLs would be beneficial for marker assistant selection of PRR tolerance varieties against both China and North America P. sojae races.

While most previous work has examined how escape from specialist enemies has influenced herbivore or pathogen resistance of exotic species, post-introduction shifts in exotic dependence on mutualists have not been considered. In a common environment, we compared dependence on AM fungi of North American and European populations of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort), a forb native to Europe. Introduced North American populations responded less to inoculation with AM fungi than did European populations. Root architecture was strongly correlated with mycorrhizal response, and introduced populations had finer root architecture than native populations. Finally, introduced populations exhibited decreased root and increased reproductive allocation relative to European populations, consistent with a transition to a weedier life history; however, biomass allocation patterns were uncorrelated with mycorrhizal response. These findings are the first demonstration of a genetically based reduction of mycorrhizal dependence and shift in root architecture in an introduced species.

This is well adapted to the unfavorable edaphoclimatic conditions found in Brazilian Semi-Arid region, where is cultivated mainly by smallholders. The selection of new rhizobial isolates is important to increase the rates of biological nitrogen fixation and yield. Furthermore, the diversity evaluation of new bacterial isolates may help us to understand the ecology of these groups in regions where little information are available. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships of peanut bradyrhizobia from Brazilian Semi-Arid soils by analysis of 16S rRNA, recA, nodC and nifD gene sequences, as well as their symbiotic performance. A trap-host experiment was performed using two soil samples from the municipality of Barbalha, Ceara, Brazil, taken under peanut cropping and one soil sample from the municipality of Juazeiro, Bahia, Brazil, covered by the native Arachis triseminata. Seeds of peanut cv. BR1 were sown and the plants were grown until 52 days after emergence. The nodules were inoculated in YMA medium for isolation of slow-growing bacteria. The Box-PCR fingerprinting and the 16S rRNA gene sequences was evaluated for all bacteria and recA, nodC and nifD were sequenced for the six selected isolates. Selected bacteria were evaluated according to their symbiotic characteristics in a greenhouse experiment. Ten slow-growing isolates were obtained and classified within the genus Bradyrhizobium, by the 16S rRNA sequence analysis and showed divergent Box-PCR profiles. All bacteria were clustered within the B. japonicum clade. The bacteria from Juazeiro were closely related to B. yuanmingense, and those from Barbalha showed similarity to B. yuanmingense, B. kavangense and B. guangxiense. The sequences of recA showed partial congruence to the 16S rRNA gene analysis but the phylogeny trees based on the symbiotic genes were not related, indicating horizontal gene transfer. All bacteria were able to efficiently nodulate the peanut and the isolate ESA 83, pointed out regarding the nitrogen fixation ability and were selected for further analysis in non-sterile soils and field conditions.

While selection and the resulting evolutionary responses may have important implications for establishment success in colonizing populations, few studies have estimated selection in such scenarios. Here we examined evidence of selection in recently established plant populations in two prairie restorations in close proximity (<15 km apart) using two approaches: (1) we tested for evidence of past selection on a suite of traits in twoChamaecrista fasciculatapopulations by comparing the restored populations to each other and their shared source population in common gardens to quantify evolutionary responses and (2) we measured selection in the field. We found evidence of past selection on flowering time, specific leaf area, and root nodule production in one of the populations, but detected contemporary selection on only one trait (plant height). Our findings demonstrate that while selection can occur in colonizing populations, resulting in significant trait differences between restored populations in fewer than six generations, evolutionary responses differ across even nearby populations sown with the same source population. Because contemporary measures of selection differed from evolutionary responses to past selection, our findings also suggest that selection likely differs over the early stages of succession that characterize young prairies.

In the present work we studied the growth and development of chiltepin (Mazocahui), under field conditions, inoculated with previously selected and cultivated native strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Azospirillum halopraeferens. The seed was inoculated by the vacuum technique, and later at 34, 120, 180 and 210 days after germination. A drip irrigation system with a salinity (TDS) = 0.8 ppt was used. The results show that germination is significantly favored by the promoter effect caused by the beneficial bacteria. These inoculants increased some parameters of growth and development. We found significant differences regarding the control for the total weight and length of root and stem of the plants, as well as the total content of proteins, and in some parts of the plant analyzed as stem and leaf. Both bacteria increased fruit yield in the Mazocahui genotype. Our findings suggest that the application of strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Azospirillum halopraeferens, influence the increase in yield of Capsicum annuum var. aviculare, under field conditions.

This new selection marker system was based on the principle that only the transformed plants could convert mannose to fructose. A transformed plant could then use the fructose as carbon source by using pmi gene that can recognize phosphomannose-isomerase that converts mannose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate. Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 contained pNWB-HSP101 vector linked with HSP101. Five days after germination, the heat tolerant gene was inoculated into the cauliflower's hypocotyl. After culturing, selection was performed in MS medium that contained 2 mg.L-1 BAP, 2 mg.L-1 NAA, 0.4% (w/v) mannose and 2.0% (w/v) sucrose. PCR, Southern blot and Northern blot analyses were performed to determine whether HSP101 gene was inserted in the transformed plant. After acclimation, T-1 seeds were successfully collected from the transformed plants in the greenhouse. This is the first report for successful transformation of cauliflower plant using the mannose selection system. Moreover, the stable selection system established in this study could be applied an alternative reducing antibiotics for human health and environmental safety during the genetic transformation of higher plants.

Contribution of selected adjunct or attenuated non-starter lactobacilli to ripening of Italian caciotta cheese	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF DAIRY TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							LACTIC-ACID BACTERIA; CHEDDAR CHEESE; PLANTARUM; STARTER	Non-starter adventitious lactobacilli grow in cheese, reaching elevated numbers during late ripening. The interest may concern the use of non-starter lactobacilli as an adjunct in the form of fresh or attenuated cells. The use of adjunct starters may have several repercussions for flavour and acceleration of the maturation, depending on microbial species/strains and/or the cheese varieties. Caciotta is a traditional cows' milk cheese manufactured in Italy. Usually, ripening of this variety is not extended to more than three months. This work aimed to study the effect of selected non-starter lactobacilli adjuncts, in the form of fresh or attenuated cells, on the ripening of caciotta cheese. In a preliminary study, 60 strains of mesophilic lactic acid bacteria were screened based on the following enzyme activities: aminopeptidase type N, proline iminopeptidase, endopeptidase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and cystathionine lyase. Lactobacillus easel LC01, Lactobacillus curvatus 2770 and Lactobacillus paracasei FC25 were selected and used as adjuncts, in form of fresh or attenuated cells for making caciotta cheese at an industrial plant. The control cheese was manufactured under the same conditions, except for the adjunct. Cheeses were analysed during the ripening (60 days) for chemical and microbiological composition. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) analysis was used to monitor the population of non-starter lactobacilli during caciotta cheese ripening. Proteolysis was evaluated by the determination of total and individual concentration of free amino acids and by urea-PAGE and RP-FPLC analyses of water-soluble and insoluble fractions. Enzyme activities were determined in the water extract of the cheeses. Aust. J. Dairy Technol. 65, 189-191	[Di Cagno, R.; De Pasquale, I.; De Angelis, M.; Calasso, M.

Using a range of chemical parameters (pH, total organic carbon content (TOC), total nitrogen content, C/N ratio), CO2 evolution, enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, polyphenol oxidase, urease) and germination assays, the composition, stability and maturity of the compost produced were assessed. Inoculation reduced crude fat and decreased the maturation time of the compost when compared with the control. TOC, C/N ratio, CO2 evolution, and enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, polyphenol oxidase, urease) decreased, pH, total nitrogen content, germination rate, and germination index increased. The dehydrogenase, polyphenol oxidase, and urease activities were shown to be useful indicators for the stability of food waste composts. Based on germination assays, the food waste composts were phytotoxicity free and matured after composting for 2 months. Therefore, inoculation of food waste with the thermo-tolerant lipolytic actinomycete, T. vulgaris A31, presents as a feasible strategy to convert food wastes into mature compost efficiently.

J	476	NG	Pawlowska, TE; Taylor, JW				Pawlowska, TE; Taylor, JW			Organization of genetic variation in individuals of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	NATURE			English	Article							EVOLUTION; EXCHANGES; ORIGIN; DRIVE	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomeromycota) are thought to be the oldest group of asexual multicellular organisms. They colonize the roots of most land plants, where they facilitate mineral uptake from the soil in exchange for plant-assimilated carbon(1). Cells of AM fungi contain hundreds of nuclei. Unusual polymorphism of ribosomal DNA observed in individual spores of AM fungi inspired a hypothesis that heterokaryosis-that is, the coexistence of many dissimilar nuclei in cells-occurs throughout the AM fungal life history(2,3). Here we report a genetic approach to test the hypothesis of heterokaryosis in AM fungi. Our study of the transmission of polymorphic genetic markers in natural isolates of Glomus etunicatum, coupled with direct amplification of rDNA from microdissected nuclei by polymerase chain reaction, supports the alternative hypothesis of homokaryosis, in which nuclei populating AM fungal individuals are genetically uniform. Intrasporal rDNA polymorphism contained in each nucleus signals a relaxation of concerted evolution(4), a recombination-driven process that is responsible for homogenizing rDNA repeats(5). Polyploid organization of glomeromycotan genomes could accommodate intranuclear rDNA polymorphism and buffer these apparently asexual organisms against the effects of accumulating mutations.

Since silicon has been shown to suppress a number of plant diseases including some caused by bacteria, a study was conducted to determine if this element might reduce BFB development. Yellow melon hybrid AF 4945 plants were grown in plastic pots containing soil supplemented with calcium silicate (0.00, 0.12, 0.24, 0.71 and 1.41 g Si kg(-1) of soil) and inoculated with A. citrulli 20 days after plant emergence. Incidence (INC) and severity were evaluated every 4 days up to 20 days after inoculation. In addition, the incubation period (IF), disease index (DI), and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) were determined. Plant growth along with macro- and micro-nutrient accumulation also were determined from 45-day-old plants. The highest Si dose significantly reduced INC (50%), DI (89%), and AUDPC (85%) and increased the IF (192%) in comparison to the control. This dose also elevated soil Si levels, soil pH and Ca + Mg respectively by 62, 17 and 29%, whereas H + Al was reduced by 62%. Plant height (9%), shoot (24%) and root (49%) fresh weights as well as shoot dry weights (33%) were also significantly increased by 1.41 g Si kg(-1) of soil. At this dose, Ca and Mg shoot concentrations reached 124 and 59%, respectively, and Si content increased up to the 0.24 g Si (39%) in comparison to the control. Supplying Si to melon plants clearly enhanced resistance to BFB but also elevated Ca and Mg levels in the plant tissue. Improved plant nutrition in melon appears to play an important role in helping to suppress BFB development, (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We modeled the community-level outcomes of competition, using experimentally derived competitive effects and responses between an exotic invasive plant, Centaurea stoebe, and species from both its native and nonnative ranges and using changes in these effects and responses elicited by experimentally establishing symbioses between C. stoebe and fungal endophytes. Using relative interaction intensities (RIIs) and holding other life-history factors constant, individual-based and spatially explicit models predicted competitive exclusion of all but one North American species but none of the European species, regardless of the endophyte status of C. stoebe. Concomitantly, C. stoebe was eliminated from the models with European natives but was codominant in models with North American natives. Endophyte symbiosis predicted increased dominance of C. stoebe in North American communities but not in European communities. However, when experimental variation was included, some of the model outcomes changed slightly. Our results are consistent with the idea that the effects of competitive intensity and mutualisms measured at small scales have the potential to play important roles in determining the larger-scale outcomes of invasion and that the stabilizing indirect effects of competition may promote species coexistence.

A bioassay was set in the laboratory using Elisa plates in a completely randomized design. Amounts of 200 mu L of metabolites of each of the five isolates of estreptomycets were used with 100 nematodes. Drinking water served as control, in a total eight replicates (each replicate consists of a cavity plate). The percentage of dead nematodes was determined after a period of 24 hours. The mortality rates of S. Bradys in the metabolites ranged from 87.2% to 100%. In a greenhouse an experiment was installed in a randomized block design where tubers were immersed for 24 hours in suspension containing seed of each of the three isolated from estreptomycets assessed or in drinking water (control treatment), with 10 repetitions (each replicate consists of a pot with two plants). The tubers-seed were planted in sterile soil and fifteen days after germination was carried out the inoculation of 2000 nematodes per plant. The assessment of nematodes per tuber was conducted five months after inoculation. There was a reduction of 84.5% to 95.4% in the number of nematodes in tubers inoculated with the isolated estreptomycets. These results suggest that the isolates from estreptomycets; have a potential biocontrol activity against S. bradys.

Late flowering was determined by a single major dominant gene in the first cross whereas earliness was dominant in the second cross. The same F, population of the second cross planted at Lincoln, NE, in 1983 exhibited a continuous distribution for this trait. A narrow sense heritability of 22% for the days to flowering was estimated. The parents and their progenies were inoculated with three Xcp isolates. The reaction to Xcp was quantitatively inherited. Narrow sense heritability values of 11 and 10% for the disease reactions were estimated for two isolates in the cross Iguacu x PI207262. A significant positive association was observed between the above traits in the cross Constanza x GN Tara.

Following inoculation with 50 Belonolaimus longicaudatus per pot, nematodes peaked at a mean of 2,139 nematodes per pot 84 days after inoculation, remained stable through 168 days at 2,064 nematodes per pot, and declined at 2 1 0 days. The relative numbers of juveniles and adults demonstrated senescence after 84 days. Root dry weight of nematode-inoculated plants increased briefly to an apparent equilibrium 84 days after inoculation, whereas root weights of uninoculated controls continued to increase, exceeding those of inoculated plants from 84 to 2 10 days (P < 0.0 1). At 210 days, uninoculated plants had 227% the root dry weight of inoculated plants. Transpiration of FX-313 was reduced by nematodes (P < 0.0001) at 84 and 126 days after inoculation; reduction was first observed at 42 days and last observed 168 days after inoculation (P < 0.05). OM content affected all plant performance variables at multiple dates, and generally there were no inoculation x OM content interactions. OM content had no effect on nematode numbers per pot, although there was a slight (P < 0.05) increase in the number of nematodes per gram root dry weight in the low-OM soil compared with the high-OM soil.

Flooding events are predicted to increase over the coming decades, calling for a better understanding of plant responses to submergence. Specific root-associated microbes alter plant hormonal balance, affecting plant growth and stress tolerance. We hypothesized that the presence of such microbes may modulate plant responses to submergence. 2. We tested whether root-associated bacteria producing the enzyme ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase affect submergence responses in Rumex palustris, a flood-tolerant riparian plant. Ethylene is a key plant hormone regulating flood-associated acclimations, and ACC deaminase activity of bacteria may decrease ethylene levels in the plant. Rumex palustris plants were inoculated with Pseudomonas putida UW4 or an isogenic mutant lacking ACC deaminase, and subsequently exposed to complete submergence. 3. Submergence triggered ethylene-mediated responses, including an increase in leaf elongation and shoot fresh weight. Flood responses, including post-submergence ethylene production, were reduced in plants inoculated with ACC deaminase-producing wild type bacteria, as compared to plants inoculated with the ACC deaminase-negative mutant. 4. Synthesis. We demonstrate that root-associated bacteria can alter plant response to environmental stress by altering plant hormonal balance. Plant-microbe interactions may thus be an overseen driver of plant life-history strategies that should be taken into account when assessing plant ecological adaptations such as abiotic stress resistance.

J	485	NG	Dorrance, AE; Inglis, DA				Dorrance, AE; Inglis, DA			Assessment of greenhouse and laboratory screening methods for evaluating potato foliage for resistance to late blight	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							PHYTOPHTHORA-INFESTANS MONT; SEEDLING PROGENY TEST; FIELD-RESISTANCE; NORTHWESTERN WASHINGTON; METALAXYL; POPULATIONS; COMPONENTS; GENOTYPES; CULTIVARS; FITNESS	Greenhouse and laboratory screening methods for assessing potato foliage for resistance to late blight were compared using 15 cultivars and advanced breeding selections with known field response to late blight. Screening methods included greenhouse inoculation of plants in several age classes, and laboratory assays of detached leaflets, leaf disks, and stem cuttings. Greenhouse inoculation of plants 7 to 11 weeks after planting, near the time of flowering, corresponded best to results obtained in field evaluations, but there were significant differences in disease severity between separate greenhouse tests. This is consistent with variation in late blight severity on a year-to-year basis when cultivars are compared in the field. The greenhouse inoculation method allowed for testing of several components of partial resistance, such as infection efficiency and lesion growth rate, which may exist for each cultivar. Laboratory assays proved less reliable than greenhouse assays for overall ratings of partial resistance, but could be useful for measuring specific components of resistance. Screening evaluations for late blight resistance should include standard cultivars with known reaction to Phytophthora infestans to reference the disease potential within the screening evaluation.

In this study, strigolactones in root exudates from 12 Fabaceae plants, including hydroponically grown white lupin (Lupinus albus), a nonhost of AM fungi, were characterized by comparing retention times of germination stimulants on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with those of standards and by using tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). All the plant species examined were found to exude known strigolactones, such as orobanchol, orobanchyl acetate, and 5-deoxystrigol, suggesting that these strigolactones are widely distributed in the Fabaceae. It should be noted that even the nonmycotrophic L. albus exuded orobanchol, orobanchyl acetate, 5-deoxystrigol, and novel germination stimulants. By contrast to the mycotrophic Fabaceae plant Trifolium pratense, in which phosphorus deficiency promoted strigolactone exudation, neither phosphorus nor nitrogen deficiency increased exudation of these strigolactones in L. albus. Therefore, the regulation of strigolactone production and/or exudation seems to be closely related to the nutrient acquisition strategy of the plants.

Punching above their weight: low-biomass non-native plant species alter soil properties during primary succession	OIKOS			English	Article							MICROBIAL BIOMASS; TROPHIC CASCADES; DIVERSITY; INVASION; COMMUNITIES; IMPACTS; GRASS; INVASIBILITY; ECOSYSTEMS; PREDATION	Non-native invasive plants can greatly alter community and ecosystem properties, but efforts to predict which invasive species have the greatest impacts on these properties have been generally unsuccessful. An hypothesis that has considerable promise for predicting the effects of invasive non-native plant species is the mass ratio hypothesis (i.e. that dominant species exert the strongest effects). We tested this hypothesis using data from a four year removal experiment in which the presence of two dominant shrub species (one native and the other not), and subordinate plant species, were manipulated in factorial combinations over four years in a primary successional floodplain system. We measured the effects of these manipulations on the plant community, soil nutrient status and soil biota in different trophic levels of the soil food web. Our experiment showed that after four years, low-biomass non-native plant species exerted disproportionate belowground effects relative to their contribution to total biomass in the plant community, most notably by increasing soil C, soil microbial biomass, altering soil microbial community structure and increasing the abundance of microbial-feeding and predatory nematodes. Low-biomass, non-native plant species had distinct life history strategies and foliar traits (higher foliar N concentrations and higher leaf area per unit mass) compared with the two dominant shrub species (97% of total plant mass). Our results have several implications for understanding species' effects in communities and on soil properties. First, high-biomass species do not necessarily exert the largest impacts on community or soil properties. Second, low-biomass, inconspicuous non-native species can influence community composition and have important trophic consequences belowground through effects on soil nutrient status or resource availability to soil biota. Our finding that low-biomass non-native species influence belowground community structure and soil properties more profoundly than dominant species demonstrates that the mass ratio hypothesis does not accurately predict the relative effects of different coexisting species on community- and ecosystem-level properties.

Both the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant growth regulators (PGR) exert beneficial effects on plant growth even under stress, but combined effect of both of them has not been evaluated yet. Present investigation was aimed to determine the responses of 2 chickpea varieties (differing in drought tolerance) to 3 PGPR viz. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus megaterium and PGR (SA and Putrescine) on physiology of chickpea grown in sandy soil. The PGR, Salicylic acid (SA) and Putrescine (Put) were sprayed on the seedling 20 days after germination. Results revealed, synergistic effects of PGPR and PGR on chlorophyll, protein and sugar contents. Addition of PGR to PGPR inoculated plants assisted the plant in osmoregulation and amelioration of oxidative stresses and in induction of new proteins. Combined application of PGR and PGPR decreased lipid peroxidation more effectively but increased the leaf area. It is inferred that PGPR and PGR work synergistically to promote growth of plants under moisture and nutrient deficit condition of sandy soil. Since, SA induces Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) in plants hence the addition of SA along with PGPR may render the plant more productive and better tolerant to diseases/pathogen attack.

When P. glumae invaded into flowering spikelets at a density of 1 cfu/grain or more, the population of bacteria in spikelets greatly increased up to 9 days after the flowering day, resulting in bacterial grain rot of rice. In rice spikelets the time of accumulation of intermediate sugars for the biosynthesis of grain starch were consistent with the time of increase of bacterial population. P. glumae was able to utilize intermediate sugars except for sucrose and triose phosphates. Oxolinic acid (5-ethyl-5,8-dihydro-8-oxo[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid, Starner(R) had an antibacterial activity against P. glumae on the epiderimis of spikelets, and reduced the bacterial infectivity into rice spikelets. Oxolinic acid applied to flowering spikelets also inhibited multiplication of P. glumae invaded into spikelets and protected grains from bacterial grain rot of rice.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of soybeans to foliar application of N in different stages of phenology and the application of inoculant with the diazotrophic bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse at the State University of Mato Grosso, Alta Floresta-MT. The completely randomized experimental design was used in a 4x2 factorial arrangement, with 4 nitrogen application times (R1 - Beginning of flowering, R3 - Final flowering, R5.1 - Grains perceptible to touch and R5.3 - Most pods between 25 -50% granulation) and presence or absence of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, with 4 replicates. It was concluded that the application of leaf nitrogen in the non-stage soybean crop provided an increase in the accumulation of nitrogen in the aerial part, there is no number of pods and grains per plant. The presence of the inoculant provided a larger number of pods when applicable. N in the periods R1 and R3, and for the aerial part dry matter, the best result obtained when it was obtained in R 5.3, in the absence of the inoculant.

The fumigant and the pesticides initially reduced VAM fungal colonisation and the number of spores in all plants. Following the initial decrease there was a slow recovery, but by 90 days after emergence, root colonisation was either parallel to or still lower than the control, and the number of spores was still well below control levels for all species except C. cajan, which had more VAM spores than the control in all treatments except fumigation and Furadon. Although the number of nodules did not differ from control levels at 30 days after emergence, differences were evident during the later stages of plant growth for all species except V. unguiculata. The effect of pesticides on VAM fungi and root nodulation varied with the associated host plant species. Plant tissue P and VAM colonisation were significantly correlated in all host plants. The pesticide treatments had no marked effect on plant growth, but accumulations of nutrients in pesticide-treated plants were lower than those in untreated plants. Growth and nutrient status of the legumes varied with VAM fungal colonisation.		UDAIYAN, K (corresponding author), BHARATHIAR UNIV,DEPT BOT,MICROBIOL LAB,COIMBATORE 641046,TAMIL NADU,INDIA.

In an effort to identify a source of resistance, we developed a more streamlined detached fruit method for high-throughput screening and tested the U.S. cucumber PI collection for fruit rot resistance. A total of 1076 PI collections, from 54 geographic locations around the world, along with the susceptible commercial cultivar, Vlaspik, were grown in the field and tested for resistance to P. capsici. Using the knowledge gained from our prior studies regarding greater susceptibility of young fruits compared with older fruits, very young fruits (approximate to 3 to 4 days post-pollination) were collected and inoculated with zoospore suspensions of P. capsici isolate OP97. From the screens performed in 2011 and 2012, 99% of the tested PIs were rated as moderately or highly susceptible based on symptom development and pathogen growth at 5 days post-inoculation. The cv. Vlaspik control showed consistent high susceptibility to P. capsici with a mean symptom rating of 8.0 on a 9-point scale. A set of 28 PIs was chosen for further testing in the greenhouse or field in 2013. The disease ratings of PIs rescreened in 2013 were much lower compared with that of the full collection of Pis. Three accessions, PI109483, PI178884, and PI214049, showed consistent low mean disease ratings and may be considered as possible sources of resistance to young cucumber fruit infection by P. capsici. Evaluation of the S-1 progeny of PI109483 suggests that the resistance is heritable and should allow for development of useful breeding materials that can be used for developing P. capsici-resistant cucumber cultivars.

Effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on herbivory defense in two Solanum (Solanaceae) species	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; induced defense; herbivore; indirect effects; aboveground; belowground; Solanum ptycanthum; Solanum dulcamara	INDUCED RESISTANCE; PLANT-RESPONSES; POLYPHENOL OXIDASE; MANDUCA-SEXTA; TOMATO PLANTS; STRATEGIES; INHIBITORS; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION	Background and aims - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous soil organisms that interact with plant roots and exchange soil nutrients for plant-derived carbohydrates, frequently resulting in growth and fitness benefits for plants. These benefits may be due partly to AMF effects on plants' resistance to insect herbivores, particularly through enhancement of induced defenses. Here we studied the impacts of AMF colonization on constitutive and induced resistance in two species of nightshades, Solanum ptycanthum and S. dulcamara. Methods - We used a factorial design manipulating AMF presence and jasmonic acid application to determine if constitutive and induced resistance differ in the presence and absence of mycorrhizae. We measured three protein-based chemical defenses and performed a bioassay by feeding leaves of experimental plants to a specialist herbivore, Manduca sexta. Key results - The presence of AMF influenced chemical defenses in S. dulcamara, including an interaction with jasmonic acid application for polyphenol oxidase activity. Solanum ptycanthum defenses were unaffected by AMF. Caterpillar growth was also unaffected by AMF but reduced by jasmonic acid treatments, indicating that, while AMF may influence certain chemical defenses in some plant species, this does not always translate to resistance against herbivores. Conclusions - Our results emphasize the context dependency of fungi plant herbivore interactions and suggest that mycorrhizal effects on plant defense may vary with other plant traits or life history strategies.

Bacterial consortia in lab columns maintained a 99% glyphosate-degrading activity (GDA) at a hydraulic residence time of < 20 min. In this study, a pilot plant (capacity, 45 liters/min) was used for a field demonstration. Initially, activated sludge was enriched for microbes with GDA during a 3-week biocarrier activation period. Wastewater effluent was then spiked with glyphosate and NH4Cl and recycled through the pilot plant column during start-up. Microbes with GDA were enhanced by maintaining the pH at < 8 and adding yeast extract (< 10 mg/liter). Once the consortia were stabilized, the column capacity for glyphosate removal was determined in a 60-day continuous-flow study. Waste containing 50 mg of glyphosate per liter was pumped at increasing flow rates until a steady state was reached. A microbial GDA of > 90% was achieved at a 10-min hydraulic residence time (144 hydraulic turnovers per day). Additional studies showed that microbes with GDA were recoverable within (i) 5 days of an acid shock and (ii) 3 days after a 21-day dormancy (low-flow, low-maintenance) mode. These results suggest that full-scale use of immobilized bacteria can be a cost-effective and dependable technique for the biotreatment of industrial wastewater.

Stalk Rot Fungi Affect Leaf Greenness (SPAD) of Grain Sorghum in a Genotype- and Growth-Stage-Specific Manner	PLANT DISEASE			English	Article							MOISTURE-DEFICIT STRESS; CHARCOAL ROT; RESISTANCE; FUSARIUM; DROUGHT; TOLERANCE; SEVERITY; PATTERN; YIELD; TRAIT	Stalk rots are among the most prevalent and destructive sorghum diseases worldwide. Although experimental evidence is limited, delayed postflowering senescence due to the staygreen trait is accepted as a physiological means of stalk rot resistance. Staygreen has been shown to be correlated with chlorophyll content (as measured by a soil and plant analytical development [SPAD] meter). Field experiments were conducted to test the effects of Fusarium stalk rot and charcoal rot on SPAD readings at three developmental stages, to test whether staygreen genotypes are more resilient to stalk-rot-mediated chlorophyll degradation, and to examine the relationships between SPAD and stalk rot resistance and tolerance when plants were inoculated with causal organisms. Staygreen and nonstaygreen lines (two) and hybrids (two) established in the field were inoculated with Fusarium thapsinum, F. proliferatum, F. andiyazi, and Macrophomina phaseolina at 14 days after flowering. SPAD readings were obtained at soft-dough, hard-dough, and physiological maturity. Most pathogens significantly reduced the SPAD of the genotypes over the mock-inoculated control at three developmental stages. The stalk-rot-resistant and staygreen check line, SC599, showed a remarkable feature of negative senescence from soft dough to physiological maturity under disease pressure. Disease severity was significantly and negatively correlated with SPAD at all developmental stages, revealing the potential impact of the staygreen trait on stalk rot resistance. The difference between control and pathogen treated total seed weight per panicle (i.e., tolerance) was significantly and positively correlated with the. difference between control and pathogen treated SPAD at physiological maturity, demonstrating the ability of staygreen trait to enhance stalk rot tolerance under disease pressure.

The disease was common at an experimental location in Gansu Province where it was recognized by the occurrence of stunted plants with reddish-brown stems and yellow and necrotic leaf blades. An Embellisia sp. was isolated from symptomatic stem, leaf blade, petiole, and root tissues at varying frequencies of up to 90%. Single-spore isolates grew very slowly on PCA, PDA, V-8 and, wheat hay decoction agar. Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculation of seeds, dipping 2-day-old pre-germinated seedlings in inoculum and spraying inoculum on 6-month-old plants. Symptoms on test plants included yellow leaf lesions, brown lesions on stems and petioles, stunted side-shoots with yellow, small, distorted and necrotic leaves, shoot blight, bud death, crown rot, root rot, and plant death. The disease is named as 'yellow stunt and root rot' of A. adsurgens to distinguish it from diseases caused by other known pathogens. Embellisia sp. is also pathogenic to A. sinicus but not to 11 other tested plant species.

ML-131) plants. The response of salinity to various parameters varied with growth stages. Leaf nitrate reductase activity (NR, EC 1.6.6.1) was greater in mycorrhizal (M) plants at S2 level but nitrogenase activity (N2ase, EC 1.18.2.1) was similar in the two types of plant. Proline accumulation was greater in M plants at S1 level at both growth stages while it was only so at S2 levels at the PF stage while only at S2 level at F. The concentration of total sugars was greater with M plants at S2 level at both growth stages while it was so for total N only at F. There was greater Mn concentration in M plants at both salt levels and at both the growth stages while it was so, only for K, Zn and Fe at S1 level at PF. Similar concentrations of K and Na were observed in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants at S2 level at both growth stages. These results suggest that, in general, the mycorrhizal inoculation has beneficial effect on plant metabolism under NaCl salinity in moong plants.

This study was carried out to evaluate the relationship of the status of nodulation (i.e., the number of nodules, their shape and size) in root and biomass production of plant growth parameters (i.e., number of leaves, shoot lengths, root biomass and shoot biomass) of Dalbergia sissoo seedlings. The assessment was conducted 60 days after seed germination. The study revealed significant differences of nodule number, leaf number, shoot height, biomass accumulation (both green and oven dry weight) with seedling age (p < 0.05). The study also revealed significant correlation among the variables of nodulation responses and biomass production. The results obtained from principal component analysis (PCA) was justified by correlation matrix of nodulation responses and biomass this species. The PCA showed root biomass, leaf number, nodule number, shoot height, age of seedling, and shoot biomass were clustered with PC1 and root shoot ratio were clustered with PC2. Our study justified shoot height may be a better determinant of nodule formation of D. sissoo.	[Azad, Md. Salim; Sumon, Md.

Fungal endophytes in a 400-million-yr-old land plant: infection pathways, spatial distribution, and host responses	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						endomycorrhiza; interaction; Nothia aphylla; parasitism; Pragian-earliest Emsian (Early Devonian); Rhynie chert	RHYNIE CHERT; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE; DEFENSE; PATHOGENS	The Early Devonian Rhynie chert has been critical in documenting early land plant-fungal interactions. However, complex associations involving several fungi that enter into qualitatively different relationships with a single host plant and even interact with one another have not yet been detailed. Here, we studied petrographic thin sections of the Rhynie chert plant Nothia aphylla. Three fungal endophytes (co)occur in prostrate axes of this plant: narrow hyphae producing clusters of small spores; large spherical spores/zoosporangia; and wide aseptate hyphae that form intercellular vesicles in the cortex. Host responses on attack include bulging of infected rhizoids, formation of encasement layers around intracellular hyphae, and separation of infected from uninfected tissues by secondarily thickened cell walls. A complex simultaneous interaction of N. aphylla with three endophytic fungi was discovered. The host responses indicate that some of the mechanisms causing host responses in extant plants were in place 400 million yr ago. Anatomical and life history features of N. aphylla suggest that this plant may have been particularly susceptible to colonization by fungi.

The contribution of fungi to carbon and nutrient cycles, along with their capability to mobilise soil trace elements, is well-known. However, the importance of life history strategy for these functions has not yet been thoroughly studied. This study explored the soil-fungi relationship of two wild edible fungi, the ectomycorrhizal Laccaria laccata and the saprotroph Volvopluteus gloiocephalus. Fruiting bodies and surrounding soils in a mine-spill contaminated area were analysed. Isotope analyses revealed Laccaria laccata fruiting bodies were N-15-enriched when compared to Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, likely due to the transfer of N-15-depleted compounds to their host plant. Moreover, Laccaria laccata fruiting bodies delta C-13 values were closer to host plant values than surrounding soil, while Volvopluteus gloiocephalus matched the delta C-13 composition to that of the soil. Fungal species presented high bioaccumulation and concentrations of Cd and Cu in their fruiting bodies. Human consumption of these fruiting bodies may represent a toxicological risk due to their elevated Cd concentrations.

Dead and living leaves of three pear varieties (Abate Fetel, Conference and William), seven grasses (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, Festuca ovina, Lolium perenne, Digitaria sanguinalis and Setaria glauca) and Trifolium repens, which are used in pear orchard lawns, were inoculated with conidia of Stemphylium vesicarium virulent on pear and incubated under controlled-environment. Stemphylium vesicarium was always re-isolated from dead leaves of the considered plants, but not from symptomless green or yellowish living leaves. The fungus was occasionally re-isolated from leaf segments showing unspecific necrosis. Inoculation of pear leaves with isolates from grasses demonstrated that the fungus did not lose pathogenicity. Pseudothecia, ascospores and conidia were produced on all the dead inoculated leaves; differences between specimens were found for phenology of pseudothecia, their density and size, and for the number of conidia produced. Pseudothecia were produced faster in the lawn species than in pear leaves, and their density was higher, especially for S. glauca, L. perenne and P. pratensis. Ascospore maturation and ejection was more concentrated for the pseudothecia developed on pear leaves than for those on F. ovina and S. glauca.

Peanut (Arachis hypogea) is an important legume grain consumed by humans and utilized for effective nutrient cycling in a diverse cropping system. Areas that have been cultivated with perennial pasture for decades may have nutritional deficiencies and lack a sufficient population of atmospheric nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Molybdenum is an essential micronutrient that is part of the enzyme nitrogenase contained within symbiotic Bradyrhizobium bacteria, which are responsible for fixing nitrogen in legumes. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of application of Mo at different rates and a rhizobial inoculant on peanut growth characteristics. The experiment was conducted in the 2009/2010 growing season in a no-tillage cropping system following 20-year use as pasture [Urochloa brizantha (Syn. Brachiaria brizantha)]. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replicates. The main plots were characterized by peanut inoculation with Bradyrhizobium inoculant or without, and the split plots were characterized by different rates of molybdenum (0, 50, 100, and 200 g ha(-1)) applied to leaves in the form of ammonium molybdate. The nutritional status of plants, nodulation (number of nodules and nodule dry matter per plant), nitrogenase activity, and nitrogenase specific activity were evaluated at 45 and 64 days after emergence (DAE). The yield components and kernel yield were evaluated at the end of the growing season. Nitrogenase enzyme activity at 64 DAE approximately doubled, and the number of pods per plant was greater with inoculation than without, both of which led to greater yields of pods and kernels. In long-term pasture areas, inoculation and molybdenum fertilization greater than the currently recommended rate appear to be necessary to increase pod and kernel yield per hectare of peanut when managed under no-tillage.

The aim of this study was to assess the potential of some biorational agents to control A. arborescens and their plant growth promoting of wheat. Seed treatments with spore suspensions of Trichoderma harzianum and Eppicoccum nigrum, extracts from Lippia alba and garlic, sodium bicarbonate, salicylic acid (SA), potassium chloride and dibasic sodium phosphate (SP) were applied to grains of wheat cultivar BIOINTA 1004 before their inoculation with the pathogen. After 7 days, seed germination and infection, necrotic symptoms on emerged seedlings and fresh weight were evaluated. Remarkable results were obtained with L. alba, SA and SP treatments that reduced symptoms markedly compared with the control. Interestingly, necrosis of radicles was significantly reduced by the application of all treatments tested. Moreover, fresh weight of seedlings was significantly increased with the application of the two antagonists, diluted garlic juice and the three tested salts in comparison with controls. Therefore, a positive role as growth promoters can be elucidated. It is concluded that compounds here tested have potential as ecofriendly alternatives to control seed-borne Alternaria fungi of wheat.

All 12 plant species sampled in the forest were arbuscular mycorrhizal. The percent root infection and spore production were closely related to the phenology of the plants. Most tree species and all herbaceous species had the highest infection in the summer rainy season, bur two species, Opuntia excelsa and Jacquinia pungens, had highest infection in the dry season. Unusually high rainfall during the dry season was associated with increased infection bur not increased spore production. Spore density was low for all species at all sample times, except at the beginning of the July 1993 rainy season in, when we observed up to 28 spores/g soil. The percent cover of shrubs or herbs did nor increase in gaps after two years, and we observed no colonizing seedlings. No plane species with cover higher than 2.7 percent occurred exclusively in gaps or forest. The percent mycorrhizal infection did nor differ significantly between gaps and forest. Spore counts were as high in the gaps as in the forest in two of the three gaps but lower in the third gap. The lack of significant response of plants in these gaps after two years differed from the rapid response in tropical rainforests. it is likely related to the small size of the gaps and to light infiltration to the forest floor. Pastures were dominated by two species of exotic grasses and one species of mycorrhizal fungus, whereas forests had lj fungal species. The slow regrowth of vegetation in gaps was not limited by mycorrhiza fungi, since they were still abundant after the treefalls, bur recovery in pastures could be affected by low fungal diversity and dominance of grasses.

Studies indicate that many soil bacteria and fungi (e.g. mycorrhizal) play a role in Fe nutrient cycling and plant production, but the evidence for fungal support of plant growth is overwhelmingly correlative and in need of experimental corroboration. An Andean native potato landrace was grown in a greenhouse under Fe limitation and using three levels (Low, Medium, High) of foliar fertilization (FeEDDHA). Application occurred at 45, 60 and 70 days of growth corresponding to periods where Fe limitation is expected to be greatest. The rhizosphere soils were sampled at the flowering stage (80 days). Soil bacterial and fungal communities were examined using high-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS regions of ribosomal RNA gene, respectively, followed by analysis using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME v1.8). Multivariate data analyses showed that Fe fertilization of leaves significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the beta diversity of fungi but not bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. Using our novel approach, it was expected and confirmed that fungal communities would shift and mycorrhizal genera (Glomus) would be altered, however, the degree to which community change was observed was more than expected. Glomeromycota (-16.3%) related to the family Gigasporaceae accounted for 2.8% of OTU and were 2-3 times greater in the rhizosphere of high relative to medium and low Fe conditions. Overall, the results indicate that foliar addition of Fe influences plant Fe and resonates into the root system to affect rhizosphere fungal communities. Potato Fe status thus appears to impact potato root-fungal interactions potentially mediated through mycorrhizal fungi.

Sequestration of these chemicals may be expensive and involve a trade off with other fitness traits. Here, we tested this hypothesis. We reared Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia L.) larvae on plant diets containing low-and high-levels of iridoid glycosides (IGs) (mainly aucubin and catalpol) and tested: 1) whether IGs affect the herbivore's defense against parasitoids (measured as encapsulation rate) and bacterial pathogens (measured as herbivore survival); 2) whether parasitoid and bacterial defenses interact; and 3) whether sequestration of the plant's defense chemicals incurs any life history costs. Encapsulation rates were stronger when there were higher percentages of catalpol in the diet. Implanted individuals had greater amounts of IGs in their bodies as adults. This suggests that parasitized individuals may sequester more IGs, increase their feeding rate after parasitism, or that there is a trade off between detoxification efficiency and encapsulation rate. Larval survival after bacterial infection was influenced by diet, but probably not by diet IG content, as changes in survival did not correlate linearly with the levels of IGs in the diet. However, M. cinxia larvae with good encapsulation abilities were better defended against bacteria. We did not find any life history costs of diet IG concentration for larvae. These results suggest that the sequestering of plant defense chemicals can help herbivorous insects to defend against parasitoids.

MOENCH; GRAIN-SORGHUM; ASCOCHYTA BLIGHT; PLANT COLOR; RESISTANCE; TEMPERATURE; SUGAR; GROWTH; ALTERNARIA	Sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) has potential for bioenergy. It is adapted to a variety of U.S. locations and the extracted juice can be directly fermented into ethanol. However, little research on fungal stalk rots, diseases that pose serious constraints for yield and quality of juice and biomass, has been reported. A greenhouse bioassay was designed to assess charcoal rot (Macrophomina phaseolina) and Fusarium stalk rot (Fusarium thapsinum) in plants at maturity, the developmental stage at which these diseases are manifested. Multiple plantings of a susceptible grain line, RTx430, were used as a control for variation in flowering times among sweet sorghum lines. Lesion length measurements in inoculated peduncles were used to quantify disease severity. Sweet sorghum lines 'Rio' and `M81E' exhibited resistance to F. thapsinum and M. phaseolina, respectively; and, in contrast, 'Colman' sorghum exhibited susceptibility to both pathogens. Lesion development over time in Colman was monitored. These results will enhance molecular and biochemical analyses of responses to pathogens, and breeding stalk-rot-resistant sweet sorghum lines.

SELENIUM HYPERACCUMULATION BY ASTRAGALUS (FABACEAE) DOES NOT INHIBIT ROOT NODULE SYMBIOSIS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						adaptation; legume; plant-microbe; selenium	CONTAMINATED SOILS; MYCORRHIZAL STATUS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; COPPER TOLERANCE; PLANTS; ACCUMULATION; BISULCATUS; NODULATION; SPECIATION; HABITAT	Premise of study: A survey of the root-nodule symbiosis in Astragalus and its interaction with selenium (Se) has not been conducted before. Such studies can provide insight into how edaphic conditions modify symbiotic interactions and influence partner coevolution. In this paper plant-organ Se concentration ([Se]) was investigated to assess potential Se exposure to endophytes. Methods: Selenium distribution and molecular speciation of root nodules from Se-hyperaccumulators Astragalus bisulcatus, A. praelongus, and A. racemosus was determined by Se K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy. A series of greenhouse experiments were conducted to characterize the response of root-nodule symbiosis in Se-hyperaccumulators and nonhyperaccumulators. Key results: Nodules in three Se-hyperaccumulators (Astragalus crotalariae, A. praelongus, and A. preussii) are reported for the first time. Leaves, flowers, and fruits from Se-hyperaccumulators were routinely above the hyperaccumulator threshold (1,000 mu g Se g(-1) DW), but root samples rarely contained that amount, and nodules never exceeded 110 mu g Se g(-1) DW. Nodules from A. bisulcatus, A. praelongus, and A. racemosus had Se throughout, with a majority stored in C-Se-C form. Finally, an evaluation of nodulation in Se-hyperaccumulators and nonhyperaccumulators indicated that there was no nodulation inhibition because of plant Se tolerance. Rather, we found that in Se-hyperaccumulators higher levels of Se treatment (up to 100 mu M Se) corresponded with higher nodule counts, indicating a potential role for dinitrogen fixation in Se-hyperaccumulation. The effect was not found in nonhyperaccumulators. Conclusions: As the evolution of Se hyperaccumulation in Astragalus developed, root-nodule symbiosis may have played an integral role.

The inoculation was conducted using Bradyrhizobium elkanii, strain BR 3262. Number of nodule, nodule dry weight, shoot and root dry weight and N content in the shoot's dry matter were determined 36 days after plant emergence (DAE). Grain yield was determined 58 DAE. Differences were not verified among the treatments to root and shoot dry weight. N content in the shoot's dry matte and grain yield were higher with Mo application. The inoculation of seeds associated with Mo favor the nodulation and N content increasing grain yield in cowpea.

Recent work undertaken to characterize the mechanisms and regulation of transport through the plant NPC has resulted in the identification of key components showing similarities - and also significant differences - between plants and other organisms. Mutant studies reveal roles for nucleoporins in plant-microbe interactions, hormone response, abiotic-stress tolerance, plant development, and flowering-time regulation. Recently, significant progress has been made in identifying about 30 proteins that constitute the plant NPC as well as several NPC-associated proteins and in characterizing the structure of the plant NPC. A newly discovered connection between nuclear pore-associated proteins and inner nuclear envelope proteins expands our knowledge of plant nuclear envelope architecture.

Two cultivars of tomato were grown in a glasshouse under three treatment combinations: nonmycorrhizal, low P (NMPO); nonmycorrhizal, high P (NMP3); and mycorrhizal, low P (MPO). Mycorrhizal infection and high soil P conditions improved several vegetative (leaf area, days until first flower and leaf P concentration) and reproductive traits (total flower production, fruit mass, seed number and pollen production per plant, and mean pollen production per flower). in general, mycorrhizal and P responses were greater for reproductive traits than vegetative traits. In one cultivar, these responses were greater for the male function than the female function. Thus, mycorrhizal infection and high soil P conditions enhanced fitness through both the female and male functions. Similar trends were usually observed in the NMP3 and MPO treatments, suggesting that mycorrhizal effects were largely the result of improved P acquisition.

In addition, leaf soluble protein content (LSPC) was measured at four growth stages in both seasons. Plants were subjected to the following treatments: only fertilized with 20 kg N ha(-1) at sowing and with 40 kg N ha(-1) at 25 days after emergence (DAE) (F); only inoculated with Rhizobium tropici strain SEMIA 4080 at sowing and fertilized with 40 kg N ha(-1) at 25 DAE (I+N); and inoculated and fertilized with 20 kg N ha(-1) at sowing and with 40 kg N ha(-1) at 25 DAE (IF). An additional treatment was done only in the second season and plants were inoculated with no N fertilization at any phase (I-N). Crop growth rate and leaf area index were enhanced by IF and F treatments as compared to I+N treatment, however, net assimilation rate did not differ among the treatments. At the pollination and flowering stages for seasons, LSPC was significantly increased by IF treatment, which also caused the highest final yield compared with the remaining treatments in both seasons. Therefore, the fertilization with 20 kg N ha(-1) at sowing together with inoculation and 40 kg N ha(-1) at 25 DAE is recommended for obtaining high yield in bean cultivation with high technology. As the inoculation with Rhizobium at sowing and fertilization with 40 kg N ha(-1) at 25 DAE (I+N) had the same crop yield as plants fertilized at sowing and at 25 DAE (F), it can be recommended for a low-cost technology cultivation employed by small farmers.

Beneficial microbial species encompass different phylogenetic groups, and growth-promoting mechanisms can be direct (nutritional effects) or indirect (resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses). Seed inoculation with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can increase the growth and productivity of agricultural crops. However, few studies have been conducted to determine these effects on the seed germination and seedling growth of neotropical tree species. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effects of inoculation with PGPB on the germination, initial development and activities of the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase of seedlings of neotropical tree species. Shade-intolerant (Cecropia pachystachya, Heliocarpus popayanensis and Trema micrantha) and shade-tolerant tree species (Cabralea canjerana, Cariniana estrellensis and Trichilia elegans) were inoculated with different species of PGPB (Azospirillum brasilense, Bacillus sp. and Azomonas sp.) and allowed to germinate and grow for 45 days under greenhouse conditions. Inoculation of C. pachystachya with all types of PGPB increased the percentage of germinated seeds (GS) and the vigor index (VI), while the mean time to germination (MTG) decreased. The VI of T. micrantha increased in response to Bacillus sp. and Azomonas sp. inoculation. Cabralea canjerana showed a decreased GS and VI and an increased MTG when inoculated with PGPB and increased activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase when inoculated with Azomonas sp. Inoculation of PGPB interfered with seed germination and seedling physiology, and shade-intolerant species were more likely to benefit from inoculation. Inoculation with PGPB can modulate the seed germination patterns of neotropical tree species, with indications that the ecological group may be involved in the magnitude of the response.

It is suggested that converting the PLBs into artificial seeds by encapsulation with sodium alginate can be useful for short-term preservation and distribution to the laboratories and commercial nurseries. Prior to the production of artificial seeds, the best developmental stage of PLBs based on sizes for increased conversion to plantlet was determined. PLBs were categorized based on size and presence of shoot namely a parts per thousand currency sign2 mm (S1), > 2-4 mm (S2), > 4-6 mm (S3), > 2-4 mm with shoot (S4) and > 4-6 mm with shoot (S5). S4 and S5 gave significantly higher conversion percentage (85 and 90 %, respectively) as compared to the PLBs without shoot (S1, S2 and S3). Thus, for uniformity PLBs of 3-5 mm with shoot were used for encapsulation with sodium alginate to form artificial seeds. The feasibility of germinating artificial seeds of Dendrobium Shavin White in different substrates namely; M1 (semi-solid A1/2 Murashige and Skoog (1962) basal medium), M2 (cotton irrigated with sterilized liquid A1/2 MS basal medium), M3 (cotton irrigated with sterilized distilled water) and M4 (cotton irrigated with non-sterilized distilled water) was tested. The encapsulated PLBs regenerated well in M1 where 96 % of encapsulated PLBs germinated after 12 days of inoculation and 76 % of them converted into plantlet after 37 days of inoculation while PLBs subjected to sterile distilled water gave 56 % germination and 44 % conversion after 42 and 167 days of inoculation respectively. The ability to store encapsulated PLBs would be advantageous for transport of planting materials. Encapsulated PLBs survived longer when stored at 25 +/- A 2 A degrees C compared to 4 A degrees C, 10 A degrees C and 30 +/- A 2 A degrees C whereby storage up to 75 days retained 80-92 % survival. Further storage up to 135 days retained 52 % survival. All plantlets survived after acclimatization when transferred to charcoal media under shade.

Significant enhancement of dry matter content, leaf area development and grain yield was observed in inoculated plants as compared to controls, mainly at 24 to 28 days after emergence. At later stages, leaf senescence was delayed in inoculated plants, thus favouring dry matter accumulation and grain filling. In plants subject to an osmotic stress potential of -2.0 bar (produced by the addition of polyethylene glycol [PEG 6000]), inoculation diminished the adverse effects caused by osmotic stress such as reduction of leaf senescence. The use of the N-15 Natural Abundance Method in a pot experiment provided clear evidence for the absence of biological N fixation in sorghum inoculated with Azospirillum.

Here, we investigate the leaf and root bacterial communities of the root holoparasite Orobanche hederae and its host Hedera spp. from natural populations. Root bacteria inhabiting Orobanche were less diverse, had fewer co-associations, and displayed increased compositional similarity to leaf bacteria relative to Hedera. Overall, Orobanche bacteria exhibited significant congruency with Hedera root bacteria across sites, but not the surrounding soil. Infection had localized and systemic effects on Hedera bacteria, which included effects on the abundance of individual taxa and root network properties. Collectively, our results indicate that the parasitic plant microbiome is derived but distinct from the host plant microbiota, exhibits increased homogenization between shoot and root tissues, and displays far fewer co-associations among individual bacterial members. Host plant infection is accompanied by modest changes of associated microbiota at both local and systemic scales compared with uninfected individuals. Our results are a first step towards extending the growing insight into the assembly and function of the plant microbiome to include the ecologically unique but often overlooked guild of heterotrophic plants.

BEAUV. (Poaceae) succesfully occupies full sun to shade microhibitats on slopes facing N or E, but remarkably avoids adjacent grasslands on hillsides exposed to S or W To test whether the hot and dry microclimate of the latter exceeds the tolerance limits for this broadleaved species originally typical in the understorey of xerothermic oak forests, a field experiment was conducted when B. pinnatum plants were transplanted in soil monoliths from a xero-mesic grassland on the NE slope to an adjacent xeric grassland on the SW side (treatment) or within the same sward (control). The response of shoot phenology, leaf photochemistry and VA mycorrhizal colonization of the roots were examined. In spring shoot development was faster on the SW slope, but final shoot height and foliage area remained below that on the NE slope. During the summer drought 80% of the shoots on the SW slope died back, while senescence was only 20% on the NE side. Leaf photochemistry suffered photodamage in summer on the SW slope, but not on the NE one. Autum rains triggered a vigorous development of new shoots on the SW slope, while not on the NE side. The frequency of VAM-infected roots and of vesicles remained invariant during the vegetation period, while the proportion of arbuscules showed a consistent seasonal trend paralelling host plant physiological activity being high during the spring and autumn, while greatly depressed during the hot and dry summer. The decline in summer was more marked on the SW slope witnessing a mass shoot dieback, and the production of new shoots here were associated with a threefold enhancement of arbuscule frequency compared to that on the NE side. These results show that the growth of developed B. pinnatum plants suffer substantial reduction and even damage on the SW slope confirming the original hypothesis that the physical environment there is not conducive for this grass and thus may explain its local distribution pattern.

Two trials were conducted in different environmental conditions in a randomized block design with treatments arranged as a 2 x 5 factorial scheme and three replications. Treatments consisted of two hybrids (H8664, resistant and H8621, susceptible) inoculated at three growing stages (8-leaf, 12-leaf and tasseling stage). Internal lesion length, adjusted yield, and yield components (length, diameter and ear weight) were evaluated 120 days after emergence. Significant differences in yield and ear weight were detected in the susceptible hybrid inoculated at the earliest stage: yield was reduced by 16.1 and 20.2% in the first and second experiment, respectively. Although lesion length in the susceptible hybrid was approximately three times greater than in the resistant, there were no significant differences in lesion length among treatments for each hybrid. However, there were differences in the number of dead plants and ear weight. It is suggested that damage caused by early infection with C. graminicola results mainly from plant death and reduction in ear weigh rather than from the extent of colonization of the stalk.

The relative importance of these two mechanisms remains unresolved because studies have not simultaneously examined how the ecological context of the symbiosis influences both costs/benefits and the rate of vertical transmission. Fungal endophytes in grasses have provided particularly tractable systems for investigating the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of hereditary symbiosis. Here we examine interactions between a fungal endophyte. Epichloe amarillans, and its grass host, Agrostis hyemalis, under altered abiotic and biotic contexts: a gradient of water availability and in the presence versus absence of soil microbes. We show that benefits of the symbiosis were strongest when water was limiting. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level produced similar to 40% more inflorescences and greater seed mass than non-symbiotic plants, while at the highest watering level, symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants did not significantly differ in reproductive fitness. Benefits appear to accrue by allowing hosts to escape from drought, a response that has not been previously reported to be endophyte-mediated. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level flowered 9 days earlier than non-symbiotic plants. Interestingly, our results suggest the symbiosis may be costly in the presence of soil microbes, as on live soil, the biomass of symbiotic plants was lower than the biomass of symbiont-free plants. We detected no effect of either the biotic or abiotic context on the rate of symbiont vertical transmission, suggesting that the context-dependent benefits of the symbiosis are the more important driver of variation in symbiont frequency in this system.

MG-4) above ground forage DM and peanut (Arachis pintoi cv. Amarillo) mixture, in soil of low fertility. The experimental design was a completely randomized in a 5x2x2 factorial arrangement, with five P rates (25, 50, 75, 100 and 200 mg/kg of soil), two inoculations (inoculated and no inoculated) and two levels of N (with and without N), with four replicates. The harvest of the above ground parts of plants was at 60 days after seed germination to determine the accumulated amounts of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S. The phosphorus and mainly the nitrogen fertilization increased the accumulation of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S in plant DM of braquiaria MG-4, however, this was not observed for mycorrhization. For forage peanut, a reduction of these minerals was observed with application of N, whereas the mycorrhization resulted in an increase of them. On the other hand, the phosphorus caused little increase in the accumulation of minerals in plant DM of peanut forage.

Little attention has been paid to nutritional studies in Aeries Aegypti larvae. Objectives: We investigated the effects of yeast, bacteria and microalgae diets on larval development, pupation time, adult size, emergence, survivorship, lifespan, and wing morphology. Materials and Methods: Microorganisms (or Tetramin (R) as control) were offered as the only source of food to recently hatched first instar larvae and their development was followed until the adult stage. Protein, carbohydrate, glycogen, and lipid were analyzed in single larvae to correlate energetic reserve accumulation by larva with the developmental rates and nutritional content observed. FITC-labeled microorganisms were offered to fourth instar larvae, and its ingestion was recorded by fluorescence microscopy and quantitation. Results and Discussion: Immature stages developed in all diets, however, larvae fed with bacteria and microalgae showed a severe delay in development rates, pupation time, adult emergence and low survivorship. Adult males emerged earlier as expected and had longer survival than females. Diets with better nutritional quality resulted in adults with bigger wings. Asaia sp. and Escherichia coin resulted in better nutrition and developmental parameters and seemed to be the best bacterial candidates to future studies using symbiont-based control. The diet quality was measured and presented different protein and carbohydrate amounts. Bacteria had the lowest protein and carbohydrate rates, yeasts had the highest carbohydrate amount and microalgae showed the highest protein content. Larvae fed with microalgae seem not to be able to process and store these diets properly. Larvae were shown to be able to process yeast cells and store their energetic components efficiently. Conclusion: Together, our results point that Ae. aegypti larvae show high plasticity to feed, being able to develop under different microorganism-based diets. The important role of Ae. aegypti in the spread of infectious diseases requires further biological studies in order to understand the vector physiology and thus to manage the larval natural breeding sites aiming a better mosquito control.

Invasive Grasses Increase Nitrogen Availability in California Grassland Soils	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Functional group; invasive species; nitrogen mineralization	PLANT INVASION; PERENNIAL GRASSES; NATIVE GRASSES; GROWTH; MINERALIZATION; DYNAMICS; BUNCHGRASSES; DOMINANCE; PATTERNS; BACTERIA	As Europeans colonized California, they introduced annual grasses from the Mediterranean Basin. These exotic annual grasses eventually invaded grasslands throughout the state, some of which were once dominated by native perennial grass species. Annual grasses differ from perennials in their phenology, longevity, rooting depth, litter chemistry, and interaction with the microbial community. As these traits may influence plant nitrogen (N) use, it is likely that the invasion by annual species resulted in changes in the availability and cycling of N in California grassland systems. We addressed the question of how invasive annual grasses influence rates of N cycling by measuring N pool sizes and rates of net and gross mineralization and nitrification, gross immobilization, and the denitrification potential of soils from experimentally planted annual and perennial-dominated grasslands. With an increase in annual grass cover, we saw increases in ammonium (NH4+) pool sizes and rates of N mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification in soils. These differences in N status suggest that N cycling in California grasslands was altered at sites where native perennial bunchgrasses were invaded by nonnative annual grasses. One consequence of annual grass invasion may be a legacy of NH4+-enriched soils that hinder the reestablishment of native perennial grass species.

Parsley seeds were planted, two plants per pot were left and inoculated with the nematode 15 days after germination. There were 10 replicates per inoculum level. Pots were maintained in a growth chamber at 26 degrees C. Fresh and dry top weights were recorded at 45 days after inoculation. After aerial biomass was removed, plants were allowed to flush for an additional 35 days (80 days after inoculation). At that time, the fresh and dry weights of the new flushes were assessed and cumulated with those recorded at 45 days after the inoculation. At this date, the final population of the nematode and gall index were also determined. The Seinhorst's model y=m+ (1-m)z(Pi-T) gave an adequate fit to the relationship between average fresh and dry top weight of plants and nematode population density. Tolerance limits (T) to the nematode for fresh weight of parsley at 45 and cumulated weights at 80 (45 + 35) days was 0.1 eggs + J2/cm(3) soil for both cases while the minimum relative yields (m) were 0.65 and 0.61 at Pi >= 16 and 8 eggs + J2/cm(3) soil, respectively. Tolerance limits (T) to the nematode for dry weight of parsley at 45 days and cumulated weights at 80 (45 + 35) days were 0.3 and 0.1 eggs + J2/cm(3) soil, and the minimum relative yields (m) were 0.6 and 0.43 at Pi >= 32 and 16 eggs + J2/cm(3) soil, respectively. Maximum nematode reproduction was 11.8-fold at Pi = 0.5 eggs and J2/cm(3) soil. The highest final population density (Pf) of the nematode was 222 eggs and J2/cm(3) soil and occurred at Pi = 256 eggs and J2/cm(3) soil. The findings of this pot experiment provide evidence of the potential damaging effect that M. enterolobii may cause to parsley under field conditions.

At 8 to 10 days after inoculation, the upper uninoculated leaves showed symptoms of virus infection and accumulation of viral coat protein (CP). Virus CP was detectable in leaves, stem, roots, seedpods, and seed coat up to 45 days postinoculation (dpi), but only in the seedpod and seed coat at 65 dpi. No virus accumulation was detected in embryos and cotyledons at any time during infection, and no seed transmission of virus was observed. Soybean plants inoculated with recombinant A1MV passaged from upper uninoculated leaves of infected plants showed accumulation of full-length chimeric A1MV CP containing rabies antigen in systemically infected leaves and seed coat. These results suggest the potential usefulness of plants and plant viruses as vehicles for producing proteins of biomedical importance in a safe and inexpensive manner. Moreover, even the soybean seed coat, treated as waste tissue during conventional processing for oil and other products, may be utilized for the expression of value-added proteins.

We investigated the effects of selective grazing of a representative nematode (Zeldia punctata, Cephalobidae) on nematode life history and population biology and on the soil microbial community. Firstly, we measured (i) the effect of five different bacterial strains on the nematode life cycle using petri dishes and (ii) the impact of bacterial inoculation on nematode population growth in a soil microcosm. Selection of the five bacterial strains was based on morphology, cell-wall characteristics and mucus production. Z punctata development was strongly affected by the type of bacteria ingested, independent of experimental design. Bacterial cell-wall characteristics seemed to directly affect Z. punctata development since high nematode densities were only reached with gram-negative strains (Pseudomonas monteilii and Methylobacterium nodulans). In petri dishes, the filamentous organisms (Actinomyces sp.) and mucus-producing bacteria (Bradyrhizobium sp.) led to the least reproduction. Duration of the various nematode life phases (egg, juvenile, reproductive stage and non-reproductive stage) was significantly affected by the bacterial food source. Total life span varied from 12.5 days (Bradyrhizobium sp.) to 40 days (Pseudomonas monteilii). Secondly, we monitored the influence of Z punctata on the indigenous soil microbial community in the presence or absence of a maize plantlet. Nematode inoculation led to an increase in bacterial activity (as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity) but did not significantly influence bacterial biomass. The genetic fingerprint (DGGE) of soil bacteria was more influenced by plant presence than by nematode inoculation. Nematode activity has important repercussions on N flux in the soil since inoculation of Z. punctata in the absence of plants resulted in a net increase of N mineralization (2 mg N per pot) while a decrease of mineral N (0.5 mg N per pot) was observed in the absence of the nematodes, due to bacterial immobilization. This study underscores the close relationship between selective bacterial grazing and nematode development. Nevertheless, the impact of nematode grazing on the overall soil microbial community seems to primarily affect microbial activity and relative dominance rather than microbial diversity.

Merr.] in this study. Variation in plant emergence allowed estimation of economically optimal seeding rates and partial returns (PR = Gross revenue Seed cost) across seed treatment options. Study results proved a single seed treatment to be superior across most study conditions. In fact, a comparison of optimally treated to untreated seed revealed that a seemingly insignificant input in terms of cost (<$8.65 ha(-1)) enhanced profitability by an average of $43.71 ha(-1) in this study. Using high rather than low quality treated seed increased producer returns by an average of $64.27 ha(-1). Seeding rate recommendations need to be viewed with the precaution that added seed may be low cost insurance against lesser-than-expected survival rates. For the cultivar Hutcheson (MG V), planting in May compared with April and June provided better yields using less seed on average. Finally, as the planting season progressed, replanting plant population density thresholds decreased.

It has previously been hypothesized that low rates of attack by natural enemies may contribute to the invasiveness of exotic plants. 2. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the influence of pathogens on survival during a critical life-history stage: the seed bank. We used fungicide treatments to estimate the impacts of soil fungi on buried seeds of a taxonomically broad suite of congeneric natives and exotics, in both upland and wetland meadows. 3. Seeds of both natives and exotics were recovered at lower rates in wetlands than in uplands. Fungicide addition reduced this difference by improving recovery in wetlands, indicating that the lower recovery was largely attributable to a higher level of fungal mortality. This suggests that fungal pathogens may contribute to the exclusion of upland species from wetlands. 4. The effects of fungicide on the recovery of buried seeds did not differ between natives and exotics. Seeds of exotics were recovered at a higher rate than seeds of natives in uplands, but this effect was not attributable to fungal pathogens. 5. Fungal seed pathogens may offer poor prospects for the management of most exotic species. The lack of consistent differences in the responses of natives vs. exotics to fungicide suggests few aliens owe their success to low seed pathogen loads, while impacts of seed-pathogenic biocontrol agents on non-target species would be frequent.

We carried out a study of Sp+ and Sp- Frankia strains based on nodules collected on Alnus glutinosa, Alnus incana and Alnus viridis. The nodules were phenotyped using improved histology methods, and endophytic Frankia strain genotype was determined using a multilocus sequence analysis approach. An additional sampling was done to assess the relation between Sp+ phenotype frequency and genetic diversity of Frankia strains at the alder stand scale. Our results revealed that (i) Sp+ and Sp- Alnus-infective Frankia strains are genetically different even when sampled from the same alder stand and the same host-plant species; (ii) there are at least two distinct phylogenetic lineages of Sp+ Frankia that cluster according to the host-plant species and without regard of geographic distance and (iii) genetic diversity of Sp+ strains is very low at the alder stand scale compared with Sp- strains. Difference in evolutionary history and genetic diversity between Sp+ and Sp- Frankia allows us to discuss the possible ecological role of in-planta sporulation.

Ecosystem isotope patterns were similar at the two forests, but differences existed that appear to reflect soil nitrogen availability and C allocation within the ectomycorrhizal symbioses. delta(15)N and delta(13)C of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi differed in both forests, and a dual delta(15)N/delta(13)C plot provided the best means of distinguishing them. Within both groups, delta(15)N and delta(13)C differed among genera and species, and the difference in species composition was an important determinant of the different overall delta(15)N of the ectomycorrhizal fungi at the two forests. Variation in multiple ecophysiological traits such as organic N use, mycelial morphology and transfer of N to phytobionts appears to underlie the variation in the isotope signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The varied isotope signatures of ectomycorrhizal fungi suggest considerable functional diversity among them. Life-history strategies could provide a framework for interpreting these patterns.

The green nodular callus developed into shoots/shoot buds on MS medium supplemented with 1.0 ppm of benzylaminopurine (BAP). Prolonged incubation on this medium increased the length of shoots with green shiny leaves. The addition of 0.25 mg l(-1) silver nitrate produced longer shoots with good growth and bigger and broader leaves; induction of new buds appeared after three months of incubation. The excised shoots developed healthy roots upon transfer to half-strength MS medium containing 1.0 ppm indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) alone or in combination with 0.01 ppm kinetin (which responded better) after 15 to 20 days of incubation.

Many exhibit a continuum of life-styles ranging from biotrophy, through to necrotrophy and ultimately to saprotrophy. This paper was initiated to establish a set of definitions for fungal life-styles, in an attempt to achieve better documentation in scientific publications of the roles played by taxa. Biotrophism is a life-style where a taxon shows high dependency on a host plant, but causes minimum damage. Biotrophs have total dependency upon living plant cells, whereas hemibiotrophs have an initial biotrophic life-style and a subsequent necrotrophic phase. The necrotrophic life-style involves actively killing host plant cells by secreting cell wall degrading enzymes and phytotoxins. Biotrophic fungi have developed an intimate relationship with the host plant using haustoria for nutrient assimilation. It is believed that biotrophy evolved when fungi developed an ability to modulate plant defense mechanisms. Therefore, biotrophs utilize different strategies to overcome host plant defenses. This paper defines the terms biotrophs and hemibiotrophs in relation to fungi and provides a discussion on its significance, role and life history.

These correlations have been interpreted to be the causal product of selection. A tacit assumption of selection on a trait is that development is canalized in the manner Waddington originally suggested for aclonal taxa, i.e. small perturbations in development result in a return to an equilibrial morphology. We tested this assumption by manipulating developing colonies of the hydroid Hydractinia echinata. The growth trajectory of these colonies follows a clone-specific schedule of production of three structures: feeding polyps, stolonal mat, and peripheral stolons. Isogeneic manipulations of the relative frequency of these structures show that developing colonies can regulate the rate of production of these three structures, but that regulation does not result in rapid convergence on a common growth trajectory.

Infection of apple fruit by Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens in the orchard in relation to Sphaeropsis rot in storage	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Apple; Latent infection; Postharvest disease; Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens; Sphaeropsis rot	BOTRYTIS-CINEREA; PEAR FRUIT; WASHINGTON-STATE; 1ST REPORT; DECAY; FLOWERS; DISEASE	Sphaeropsis rot, caused by Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens, is an important postharvest disease of apple in the United States. The objectives of this study were to determine the timing of apple fruit infection in the orchard in relation to development of Sphaeropsis rot in storage and to identify infection courts and mode of penetration by S. pyriputrescens on apple fruit. Fruit of apple cvs Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, and Fuji were inoculated in the orchard from 3 weeks after petal fall to 2 weeks before harvest at 5 to 6-week intervals in three consecutive seasons. All fruit were harvested and stored at 0 A(0)C to monitor decay development. Light and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the infection courts and mode of penetration of the fungus on/in the host tissues. At harvest, the fungus was re-isolated from the stem (pedicel), sepal, anther, or filament of the inoculated fruit, but decay did not develop on fruit. Sphaeropsis rot developed on inoculated fruit during cold storage beginning 1-3 months after harvest. Stem-end rot was prevalent on cv. Golden Delicious, whereas calyx-end rot was prevalent on cv. Fuji. Both stem- and calyx-end rots were common on cv. Red Delicious. Infection also occurred at lenticels on fruit skin, particularly on cv. Golden Delicious, but at low incidence. Relationships between the incidence of Sphaeropsis rot in stored apple fruit and the timing of inoculation in the orchard varied with cultivar and year. On cv. Red Delicious apples, the incidence of Sphaeropsis rot generally increased as the timing of infection approached harvest. Histological studies indicated that infection took place through natural openings of plant organs such as stomata on stems and sepals and lenticels on fruit skin. Fungal penetration also was observed at micro-cracks on the stem and sepal and at trichome sockets where mechanical damage occurred in sepals. Direct penetration was observed on the stem and sepal of fruit, but most invasions were restricted between the cuticle and the epidermis. Our results indicate that wounding is not required for infection of apple fruit by S. pyriputrescens, though it may facilitate infections.	[Kim, Y.

PHOSPHATE-SOLUBILIZING BACTERIA; TOMATO; MAIZE; MEDIA; YIELD	Peat moss has been a standard carrier of inoculum for experimentation and in agriculture. Peat moss is, however, a non-renewable resource. Alternatively, biochar could serve as an inoculum carrier. Here, we tested the effect of biochar-based seed coatings as a carrier for the phosphorous-solubilizing Pseudomonas libanensis inoculum, on corn growth after soluble and insoluble P addition. The survival of P. libanensis was determined based on the measure of colony-forming units from samples of four inoculated guar gum-based biochar coatings and was compared to peat. Storage experiments were performed on inoculated biochars for 22 weeks at 25 degrees C and on coated corn seeds for 16 weeks at 4 degrees C. Seed coatings were prepared with inoculated and uninoculated biochars (100 seeds treatment(-1)), and effects of these treatments are reported on indices of seed germination after 7 days. A greenhouse experiment investigated the effects of the inoculated and uninoculated biochar seed coating on corn plants. The parameters measured from the greenhouse-grown corn plants were germination, fresh weight, dry weight, height, root length, basal stem diameter, leaf area, chlorophyll content, and tissue phosphorous. Our results show that corn plants grown from seeds coated with a biochar from hardwood feedstock are 2 to 10 g heavier than controls and that controls are 4 to 26 % shorter than the plants grown from biocharcoated seeds, where soluble phosphorous is applied. Moreover, corn seeds that were coated with a biochar produced from softwood feedstock germinated more quickly, based on the speed of germination index. Overall, we show that a biochar-based seed coating can benefit sustainable agriculture by carrying P. libanensis and enhancing the growth of corn, but according to parametric statistical tests, it does so without increasing the phosphorous content of the plants.

Molecular evolution patterns reveal life history features of mycoplasma-related endobacteria associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Claroideoglomus etunicatum; Gigasporaceae; Glomeromycota; horizontal transmission; parasitism; vertical transmission	VERTICAL TRANSMISSION; BACTERIA; RECOMBINATION; GENITALIUM; SYMBIONTS; IDENTIFICATION; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; SELECTION; SOFTWARE	The mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MRE), representing a recently discovered lineage of Mollicutes, are widely distributed across arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota). AMF colonize roots of most terrestrial plants and improve plant mineral nutrient uptake in return for plant-assimilated carbon. The role of MRE in the biology of their fungal hosts is unknown. To start characterizing this association, we assessed partitioning of MRE genetic diversity within AMF individuals and across the AMF phylogeographic range. We further used molecular evolution patterns to make inferences about MRE codivergence with AMF, their lifestyle and antiquity of the Glomeromycota-MRE association. While we did not detect differentiation between MRE derived from different continents, high levels of diversity were apparent in MRE populations within AMF host individuals. MRE exhibited significant codiversification with AMF over ecological time and the absence of codivergence over evolutionary time. Moreover, genetic recombination was evident in MRE. These patterns indicate that, while MRE transmission is predominantly vertical, their complex intrahost populations are likely generated by horizontal transmission and recombination. Based on predictions of evolutionary theory, we interpreted these observations as a suggestion that MRE may be antagonists of AMF. Finally, we detected a marginally significant signature of codivergence of MRE with Glomeromycota and the Endogone lineage of Mucoromycotina, implying that the symbiosis between MRE and fungi may predate the divergence between these two groups of fungi.

Cold plasma treatment and laser irradiation of Triticum spp. seeds for sterilization and germination	JOURNAL OF LASER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						plant biotechnology; plasma chemistry; food chemistry; wheat seeds; germination; cold plasma; microbial inactivation	INVASIVE FUNGI; IMPACT; FOOD	In this research work, plasma and laser-based treatments have been applied on wheat seeds to improve their growth and development. Plasma treatment modified the surface morphology of seed which enhanced the germination rate and also exhibited great immunity against fungus; only 20% seeds are affected by fungus as compared to the untreated sample. In addition, an increase in protein concentration in plasma treated seeds has also been observed. In the laser treatment, laser pulses have been exercised on wheat seeds, while seeds were also exposed in argon plasma generated at different applied voltages and exposure times. This laser treatment lessens germination time, increases water absorption, and abolishes disease development from seed borne fungi that are present on or within seeds. Thus, it is observed that the use of plasma and laser radiation on the seeds made productive effects on the growth parameters and may be the alternative source for the presowing seed treatment.

Here, six typical forest types in northeast China were investigated to determine the dynamics of soil soluble N across seasons and plant communities, and the potential drivers. Soil free amino acids, NH4+, NO3-, dissolved organic N (DON) and a variety of soil characteristics were measured over the growing season (from May to September). Seasonality showed a stronger effect on the availability of soil inorganic N and free amino acids than vegetation. The coefficients of variation of soil inorganic N, amino acid-N and the potential drivers (moisture and DON) appeared to be greater for season, and the concentrations of these available N sources tended to be higher at the beginning than at the height of growing season. Potential soil drivers (e.g.moisture, microbial biomass-N and DON) and plant phenology together drove the seasonal dynamics of inorganic N and amino acid-N. Arginine, histidine, serine, leucine, aspartic acid, glycine, glutamic acid and proline composed the dominant soil amino acid pool in the temperate forest soils. The basic amino acids (arginine and histidine) were consistently dominant irrespective of vegetation and season, suggesting that selective sorption by the soil solid phase could play an important role in regulating the cycling of amino acid-N in these temperate forest ecosystems. This research indicates that changes in local soil properties, and plant phenology caused by seasonality, exert a powerful influence on the characteristics of plant-soil N cycling.

Manganese (Mn), which can influence the plant susceptibility to diseases, may even affect host-pathogen relationships. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil application of two N sources and five Mn doses on the severity of the wheat spot blotch disease. Additionally, shoot and root dry matter production, plant Mn uptake and soil Mn availability were evaluated. An experiment in a randomized block design was carried out in a greenhouse, in a 2 x 5 factorial scheme with two N sources [(NH4)(2)SO4 and Ca(NO3)(2)] and five Mn doses (0; 2.5; 5.0; 10.0 and 20.0 mg dm(-3)) with four replications. Plants were grown in a dystrophic Red Latosol (Oxisol), in 2.2 dm(3) plastic pots, with three wheat plants per pot. Forty-five days after emergence (DAE) the plants were inoculated with a Bipolaris sorokiniana suspension containing 10(5) conidial fungi per mL. The disease severity degree, shoot and root dry matter production, and the N and Mn leaf contents in the wheat plants were determined, as well as the soil Mn availability. The N sources and Mn doses affected only the disease severity degree, soil available Mn and leaf Mn. Quadratic responses were found for the contents of soil Mn, leaf Mn and disease severity degree as a function of the increased Mn (MnCl2 center dot 4H(2)O) rates applied to soil. The ammonium-based source [(NH4)(2)SO4] resulted in a greater Mn availability than the nitric-based source [Ca(NO3)(2)], which was followed by an increase in foliar Mn and a drop in the severity degree of wheat spot blotch.

Understanding the resilience of tropical forests to anthropogenic impacts and the period for communities to recover are critics steps for conservation policy implementation. We took advantage of a dynamic group of land plants to stud: temporal changes in their community structure over a period of 15 years at a landscape-scale experiments fragmentation site in central Amazonia. We observed an overall increase in estimated epiphyll abundances and species richness in smaller fragments (1- and 10-ha reserves) suggesting recovery rather than a belated accumulation of local extinction events. However, higher turnover in smaller fragments, when compared to large ones, was driven by increased presence of core species indicating interspecific differences in survivability. These disproportionate changes in occupancy patterns and relative abundances in fragments were best explained by life history traits reflecting increased dispersal capacity and physiological tolerances suggesting recovery of the phyllosphere community in smaller fragments (1- and 10-ha) over 15 years. Even for this group renowned for fast generation times and high reproductive output, epiphyll metacommunities of smaller fragments have yet to recover from local extinctions accrued following the initial fragmentation nearly 40 years ago. However, the interaction of dispersal capacities and physiological tolerances are playing a significant role in the recovery of their spatiotemporal distributional patterns in this experimentally fragmented landscape.

The present study evaluates the effect of Rhizophagus intraradices inoculation on tomato plant physiology and yield in response to progressive water deficit conditions. Two commercial products (Prod1 and Prod2) containing only R. intraradices were tested at two different concentrations (1% and 5% of the substrate volume) using three methods of inoculation: (a) mixed to substrate, (b) dissolved in water, (c) spread on seedlings root blocks before transplant. The highest mycorrhization of root fragments (F%) was found with Prod2 at 1% w/w at 40 days after sowing (DAS); this product was therefore used in a second experiment to inoculate tomato plants and test their physiological response to progressive water deficit induced withholding irrigation. Phenology, plant height, stem diameter, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, whole canopy gas exchange, biomass production and partitioning and phosphorus content were investigated in inoculated and not inoculated tomato plants under well-watered and water stressed conditions. Vegetative period and plant height were shorter in inoculated than in control plants; moreover, inoculation with R. intraradices increased fruit production by enhancing chlorophyll content under water stress condition, PS2 efficiency, ETR, F-v/F-m, net photosynthetic rate and whole canopy WUE.

Part of its management is focused on chemical control using cupric fungicides and strobilurins. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the efficacy of three sources and three concentrations of cupric fungicides (copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride and cuprous oxide). Orange fruits of the Pera cultivar were bagged in the plants and the treatment with cupric fungicide was applied. The fruits were inoculated (by spray) with Phyllosticta citricarpa (1x10(4) conidia mL(-1)) after 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days, and bagged again. The evaluation of incidence and severity was did at the harvest time of fruits. A second experiment was conducted under natural infection with the same treatments, consisting of application of fungicides at the stages F1 (petal fall) and F2 (fruits with diameter of 1 cm), using mechanized sprayer with mean flow of 7.35 L solution plant(-1). Subsequently, all treatments received four applications of azoxystrobin (30 g ha(-1)), plus mineral oil at 0.25%. Four monthly evaluations were done to determine the CBS incidence and severity. The initial applications with cupric fungicides are essential for the control of CBS; the fungicide copper hydroxide showed the best control of CBS with the lowest rate of metallic copper (43.7 g of Cu++ 100 L-1) in both experiments, regardless of the conduction conditions.

Alteration of photosynthetic performance and source-sink relationships in wheat plants infected by Pyricularia oryzae	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						blast; photosynthesis; Pyricularia oryzae; starch; sucrose; wheat	CHLOROPHYLL-A FLUORESCENCE; POWDERY MILDEW INFECTION; LEAF GAS-EXCHANGE; CARBOHYDRATE-METABOLISM; GENE-EXPRESSION; PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS; TOMATO PLANTS; GROWTH-STAGES; LEAVES; STARCH	Two experiments were carried out to assess the changes associated with photoassimilate production and partitioning in the source-sink relationship of flag leaves and spikes of wheat plants infected with Pyricularia oryzae, the causal agent of blast. Flag leaves and spikes were inoculated at 10 and 20 days after anthesis (daa) with a conidial suspension of P. oryzae. Analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence using maximal photosystem II quantum efficiency (F-v/F-m), fraction of energy absorbed that is used in photochemistry (YII), quantum yield of non-regulated energy dissipation (Y(NO)) and quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation (Y(NPQ)), showed an impairment of the photosynthetic performance in both infected flag leaves and spikes, coupled with reduced concentrations of chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids. Compared to non-inoculated controls, there was lower capacity for CO2 fixation by RuBisCO in the infected flag leaves. Similarly, in the infected flag leaves and grains (obtained from infected spikes), there were lower concentrations of soluble sugars, while the hexoses-to-sucrose ratio increased in infected flag leaves. Compared to non-inoculated controls, infected flag leaves showed lower sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity and lower expression of the sucrose synthesis (SuSy) gene, while higher expression and activity of acid invertases also occurred. At the advanced stages of fungal infection, the concentration of starch in grains decreased but remained high for the infected flag leaves. There were reductions in ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity and the expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase genes and a down-regulation of beta- and alpha-amylase expression at the advanced stages of fungal infection on flag leaves and spikes. In conclusion, the effect of blast on both grain quality and yield can be associated with alterations in both production and partitioning of carbohydrates during the grain filling process.	[Rios, J.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY OF MONOTROPA AND MONOTROPSIS: TWO MYCOHETEROTROPHIC GENERA IN THE MONOTROPOIDEAE (ERICACEAE)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						breeding system; Ericaceae; Monotropa; Monotropsis; mycoheterotroph; phenology; pollination; reproductive ecology	MYCORRHIZAL SPECIALIZATION; VASCULAR PLANTS; HYPOPITYS; SPECIFICITY; POLLINATION; ABORTION; GERMINATION	Studies of mycoheterotrophs, defined as plants that obtain carbon resources from associated mycorrhizal fungi, have fundamentally contributed to our understanding of the importance and complexity of symbiotic ecological interactions. However, to date, the reproductive ecology of these organisms remains empirically understudied, with existing literature presenting hypotheses about traits including a generalist pollination syndrome and autogamous self-pollination. To address this gap in our knowledge of the reproductive ecology of mycoheterotrophic plants, we comparatively analyzed three species of two monotropoid genera, Monotropa and Monotropsis. During three consecutive years of field observations and manipulations of four Populations of Monotropa uniflora, seven of M. hypopitys (both red and yellow color forms), and two of Monotropsis odorata, we investigated flowering phenology, pollination ecology, breeding system, floral herbivory, and reproductive effort and output. Contrary to previous predictions, our results revealed that taxa are largely outcross-pollinated and specialized toward Bombus pollinators. Additionally, species differ in breeding system, timing and duration of reproductive development, fluctuations in reproductive effort and output, and fitness impacts of herbivory. This Study is the first thorough investigation of the reproductive ecology of mycoheterotrophic species and provides insight into possible limitations in reproductive traits imposed by a mycoheterotrophic life history.

In 2012 we collected soil samples in the growing and non-growing season from a vegetation change experiment cropping herbaceous C3 and C4 plants for 6years on two soils differing in their texture. Phospholipid fatty acids and their compound-specific C-13 values were used to determine microbial community biomass and its composition and the assimilation of C from plants to soil microorganisms, respectively. While soil microbial biomass differed mainly between seasons, the microbial community composition was related to soil texture. The proportion of plant-derived C assimilated by soil microorganisms was best explained by soil texture, too. In contrast, differences in photosynthetic pathways of plants had no impact on microbial biomass or on microbial community composition but expectedly on the isotopic composition of the microbial markers. Our results demonstrated that vegetation, differing in C3 plants and C4 plants, has no effect on the soil microbial community and their proportion of assimilated C derived from plants, if plants are similar in their productivity and phenology. Thus, our study verifies that vegetation change experiments are beneficial in exploring the interactions of plant soil and microbes and how environmental properties, such as seasonality or soil type impact this interaction.

The use of an alternative plant would greatly facilitate a better understanding of the plant-nematode interactions. In this study, we explored the feasibility of Arabidopsis thaliana as an alternative host to investigate the relationship between plants and B. xylophilus and established a system for the efficient infection of A. thaliana by B. xylophilus (defined in this paper as the mean number of plants infested with B. xylophilus) by evaluating the artificial wounding of seedlings, ages of seedlings and nematode inoculum concentrations, and then the susceptibility of nine A. thaliana ecotypes was tested. The results showed that B. xylophilus infected all ecotypes tested. Artificially wounding the petiole of the first leaf increased the plant infection rate of B. xylophilus, reaching 90 % of the inoculated plants with inoculum concentration of 400 nematodes per plant at 15 days after germination (DAG). A typical symptom was yellowing of the entire plant and browning of older leaves 72 h after inoculation. Membrane damage of the thylakoid lamellae, collapse of chloroplasts and increase of the electron density of the cytoplasm were also observed. Our results demonstrated that B. xylophilus could invade Arabidopsis and cause similar early symptoms to that of pine trees, yet B. xylophilus could not reproduce in A. thaliana. Nonetheless, A. thaliana may be used to study the early response of plants to B. xylophilus and it provides a new opportunity for studying B. xylophilus-plant interactions.

Tag profiling using high throughput sequencing is a relatively low cost means of expression profiling with deep coverage. However the extent to which very short cDNA sequences can be effectively used in screening for candidate genes is unclear. Here we investigate this question using an evolutionarily distant as well as a closely related transcriptome for referencing tags. We do this by comparing differentially expressed genes and processes between two closely related allopolyploid species of Pachycladon which have distinct altitudinal preferences in the New Zealand Southern Alps. We validate biological inferences against earlier microarray analyses. Results: Statistical and gene annotation enrichment analyses of tag profiles identified more differentially expressed genes of potential adaptive significance than previous analyses of array-based expression profiles. These include genes involved in glucosinolate metabolism, flowering time, and response to cold, desiccation, fungi and oxidation. In addition, despite the short length of 20mer tags, we were able to infer patterns of homeologous gene expression for 700 genes in our reference library of 7,128 full-length Pachycladon ESTs. We also demonstrate that there is significant information loss when mapping tags to the non-conspecific reference transcriptome of A. thaliana as opposed to P. fastigiatum ESTs but also describe mapping strategies by which the larger collection of A. thaliana ESTs can be used as a reference. Conclusion: When coupled with a reference transcriptome generated using RNA-seq, tag sequencing offers a promising approach for screening natural populations and identifying candidate genes of potential adaptive significance. We identify computational issues important for the successful application of tag profiling in a non-model allopolyploid plant species.

This method demonstrated that coarse organic matter (> 2 mm) in the litter and topsoil was the most important reservoir of inoculum of these fungi. A new in situ seed baiting method using multi-chambered packets to simultaneously assess germination for different orchid species within soil is also introduced. These in situ and ex situ methods are compared using seed of orchids in the genera Monadenia, Microtis, Caladenia, Pterostylis and Diuris, using urban Banksia woodland sites with high or low weed cover. Both these seed baiting methods detected compatible fungi for these orchids, but common orchids germinated more frequently than those which were uncommon at the field sites. Germination rates were not significantly affected by weed cover even though adult orchids were rare in areas with high weed cover. The two new seed baiting methods vary in efficiency and applicability depending on the situation where they are used. However, the ex situ method allowed the time-course of germination to be observed, resulting in the production of more protocorms and facilitation of the isolation of mycorrhizal fungi. These techniques provide valuable new tools for detection of compatible mycorrhizal fungi to assist orchid research and conservation.

The overarching aim of this study was to investigate top-down control processes of PPN in these natural ecosystems through comparative analyses of the diversity and dynamics of PPN and their microbial enemies. Our specific aims were, first, to identify and quantify PPN microbial enemies in European sand dunes; second, to assess their life history traits, their spatial and temporal variation in these ecosystems, and third, to evaluate their control potential of PPN populations. This was done by seasonal sampling of a range of sites and making observations on both the nematode and the microbial enemy communities in rhizosphere sand. Nine different nematode microbial enemies belonging to different functional groups were detected in European sand dunes. Their high diversity in these low productivity ecosystems could both result from or lead to the lack of dominance of a particular nematode genus. The distribution of microbial enemies was spatially and temporally variable, both among and within sampling sites. Obligate parasites, either with low host-specificity or having the ability to form an environmentally resistant propagule, are favoured in these ecosystems and are more frequent and abundant than facultative parasites. Three microbial enemies correlated, either positively or negatively, with PPN population size: Catenaria spp., Hirsutella rhossiliensis and Pasteuria penetrans. Microbial-enemy supported links in the food-web may be involved in the control of PPN populations through indirect effects. The endospore-forming P. penetrans was the most successful top-down control agent, and was implicated in the direct control of Meloidogyne spp. and indirect facilitation of Pratylenchus spp. Overall, our findings suggest strong and diverse top-down control effects on the nematode community in these natural ecosystems.

Differential plant invasiveness is not always driven by host promiscuity with bacterial symbionts	AOB PLANTS			English	Article						Acacia; biological invasions; interactions; invasive; legume; mutualisms; rhizobia	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; ACACIA-CYCLOPS; RHIZOBIA; ASSOCIATIONS; MUTUALISMS; EVOLUTION; LEGUMES; TREES; COMMUNITIES; DISPERSAL	Identification of mechanisms that allow some species to outcompete others is a fundamental goal in ecology and invasive species management. One useful approach is to examine congeners varying in invasiveness in a comparative framework across native and invaded ranges. Acacia species have been widely introduced outside their native range of Australia, and a subset of these species have become invasive in multiple parts of the world. Within specific regions, the invasive status of these species varies. Our study examined whether a key mechanism in the life history of Acacia species, the legume-rhizobia symbiosis, influences acacia invasiveness on a regional scale. To assess the extent to which species varying in invasiveness correspondingly differ with regard to the diversity of rhizobia they associate with, we grew seven Acacia species ranging in invasiveness in California in multiple soils from both their native (Australia) and introduced (California) ranges. In particular, the aim was to determine whether more invasive species formed symbioses with a wider diversity of rhizobial strains (i.e. are more promiscuous hosts). We measured and compared plant performance, including aboveground biomass, survival, and nodulation response, as well as rhizobial community composition and richness. Host promiscuity did not differ among invasiveness categories. Acacia species that varied in invasiveness differed in aboveground biomass for only one soil and did not differ in survival or nodulation within individual soils. In addition, acacias did not differ in rhizobial richness among invasiveness categories. However, nodulation differed between regions and was generally higher in the native than introduced range. Our results suggest that all Acacia species introduced to California are promiscuous hosts and that host promiscuity per se does not explain the observed differences in invasiveness within this region. Our study also highlights the utility of assessing potential mechanisms of invasion in species' native and introduced ranges.

Inoculation of blossoms resulted in asymptomatic pepper fruit. However, real-time polymerase chain reaction detected X. euvesicatoria in 39% of the seed lots assayed and viable colonies were recovered from 35% of them. Successful transmission occurred in 16% of the seed lots tested. In a separate experiment, X. euvesicatoria reached populations of up to 1 x 10(5) CFU/blossom on stigmas 96 h after inoculation. Bacteria colonized stylar and ovary tissues with populations ranging from 1 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(6) CPU/blossom 96 h after inoculation. A positive correlation existed between inoculum concentration and percentage of infested seedlots. Blossoms inoculated with Acidovorax citrulli also resulted in infested pepper seedlots. Furthermore, A. citrulli colonized pepper blossoms significantly better than X. euvesicatoria by 96 h postinoculation. It was concluded that pepper blossoms can be a potential site of ingress for X. euvesicatoria into seed, and blossom colonization may be involved in pepper seed infestation. Data also indicated that seed infestation via blossoms may be nonspecific because nonhost plants can be colonized by incompatible pathogens. Thus, host pathogen interactions may not be important for bacterial ingress through blossoms.	[Dutta, B.; Gitaitis, R.; Sanders, H.; Booth, C.; Smith, S.; Langston, D.

Long recognized for flowering plants and animals, early literature suggests this life-history component may also be prevalent among multicellular fungi. We establish the basis of developmental competence-the capacity to respond to induction of asexual developmentin the filamentous saprotroph Aspergillus nidulans, describing environmental influences, including genotype-by-environment interactions among precocious mutants, gene expression associated with wild type and precocious competence acquisition, and the genetics of competence timing. Environmental effects are consistent with a threshold driven by metabolic rate and organism density, with pH playing a particularly strong role in determining competence timing. Gene expression diverges significantly over the competence window, despite a lack of overt morphological change, with differentiation in key metabolic, signaling, and cell trafficking processes. We identify five genes for which mutant alleles advance competence timing, including the conserved GTPase RasB (AN5832) and ambient pH sensor PalH (AN6886). In all cases examined, inheritance of competence timing is complex and non-Mendelian, with F-1 progeny showing highly variable transgressive timing and dominant parental effects with a weak contribution from progeny genotype. Competence provides a new model for nutrient-limited life-cycle phases, and their elaboration from unicellular origins. Further work is required to establish the hormonal and bioenergetic basis of the trait across fungi, and underlying mechanisms of variable inheritance.

Effect of the addition of phytosterols and tocopherols on Streptococcus thermophilus robustness during industrial manufacture and ripening of a functional cheese as evaluated by qPCR and RT-qPCR	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Cheese; Starter; LAB; PCR; Functional; Phytosterols	CULTURE-INDEPENDENT METHODS; LACTIC-ACID BACTERIA; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; LACTOCOCCUS-LACTIS; STARTER CULTURES; QUANTITATIVE PCR; MILK; DYNAMICS; RAW	The quality of functional food products designed for the prevention of degenerative diseases can be affected by the incorporation of bioactive compounds. In many types of cheese, the performance of starter microorganisms is critical for optimal elaboration and for providing potential probiotic benefits. Phytosterols are plant lipophilic triterpenes that have been used for the design of functional dairy products because of their ability to lower serum cholesterol levels in humans. However, their effect on the starter culture behavior during cheesemaking has not yet been studied. Here, we followed DNA and RNA kinetics of the bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus, an extensively used dairy starter with probiotic potential, during industrial production of a functional, semi-soft, reduced-fat cheese containing phytosterol esters and alpha-tocopherol as bioactive compounds. For this purpose, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and reverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) assays were optimized and applied to samples obtained during the manufacture and ripening of functional and control cheeses. An experimental set-up was used to evaluate the detection threshold of free nucleic acids for extraction protocols based on pelleted microorganisms. To our knowledge, this straight-forward approach provides the first experimental evidence indicating that DNA is not a reliable marker of cell integrity, whereas RNA may constitute a more accurate molecular signature to estimate both bacterial viability and metabolic activity. Compositional analysis revealed that the bioactive molecules were effectively incorporated into the cheese matrix, at levels considered optimal to exert their biological action. The starter S. thermophilus was detected by qPCR and RT-qPCR during cheese production at the industrial level, from at least 30 min after its inoculation until 81 days of ripening, supporting the possible role of this species in shaping organoleptic profiles. We also showed for the first time that the addition of phytosterols at functional concentrations, not only did not affect starter performance but also correlated with a significant increase in target DNA and cDNA levels in most of the time points evaluated throughout cheesemaking. Therefore, these findings suggest that the growth and metabolism of S. thermophilus may be enhanced by the incorporation of these biologically active molecules during cheese production, providing important information for the industrial design of novel fermented foods.

Seedlings from both populations were grown in greenhouses maintained at either 35.5 Pa or 71.0 Pa CO2. In both CO2 treatments, seedlings were grown in a full factorial experiment with or without mycorrhizal inoculum and with an adequate or a limiting supply of phosphorus. Seedlings were harvested 60, 90 and 120 days after emergence and at each harvest root subsamples were examined to determine the percent of fine roots that were mycorrhizal. Additionally, root carbohydrate and nutrient levels were measured at each harvest. Root starch, sugar and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations were increased by growth in elevated CO2 and decreased by mycorrhizal colonization. Phosphorus stress decreased root starch concentrations, increased root sugar concentrations and did not significantly affect TNC concentrations. However, despite significant effects on root carbohydrate levels, there were generally no significant treatment effects on mycorrhizal colonization. Additionally, at all harvests, root starch and sugar concentrations were not correlated with percent of fine roots that were mycorrhizal. These results suggest that although elevated CO2 may significantly increase root carbohydrate levels, the increases may not affect the percent of fine roots that are mycorrhizal.

Four cultivars were tested in a greenhouse environment, where the plants were spray inoculated at three different stages with a mixture of DON and NIV chemotypes of F. graminearum. The results indicate that high levels of DON and NIV can be produced beyond 20 days after anthesis (DAA), even by early infection. The results of field experiments performed on seven cultivars, where inoculation was conducted using colonized maize kernel inoculum, were consistent with the greenhouse results. In addition, in the greenhouse experiments, late infection, at least as late as 20 DAA, caused grain contamination with these toxins even without clear disease symptoms on the spike. These results indicate the importance of the late stage in grain development in DON and NIV contamination, suggesting that control strategies that cover the late as well as the early stage of grain development should be established to effectively reduce the risk of these toxins' contaminating wheat.

To quantify the effect of this damage on subsequent plant growth and development, an experiment was conducted in the glasshouse using yellow lupin, Lupinus luteus cv. Motiv, which is highly susceptible to the mites. After emergence, plants were infested with 0, 100, 150, and 250 mites/plant, collected from the field. Fourteen days after application, mites were removed. Damage to plants was estimated at seedling stage, flowering time, and maturity. At seedling stage (on Day 14), feeding damage scores to cotyledons and true leaves were greater at higher mite densities. Damaged plants produced fewer nodules, fewer lateral roots, and less dry weight than the control. On Day 35, severely damaged plants failed to recover and on the surviving plants, cotyledons and true leaves died earlier than on the plants without damage. On Day 78, when plants were flowering, the surviving plants produced fewer nodules and branches, and less dry weight per plant than the control. The flowering time of plants with the mite treatments was delayed by up to 6 days compared with the controls. The final shoot dry weight, pod number, seed number, and seed yield per pot were significantly reduced by the mite treatments. Feeding by H. destructor on seedlings of yellow lupin caused a reduction in seed yield of 58% at the highest mite density treatment. This significant economic loss needs to be confirmed under field conditions, but it signifies the need to develop appropriate control measures for this pest.

This study investigates intertrophic links between tree diversity and soil microbial community function and composition. We examined how microbial communities in surface mineral soil responded to experimental gradients of tree species richness (SR), functional diversity (FD), community-weighted mean trait value (CWM), and tree identity. The site was a 4-year-old common garden experiment near Montreal, Canada, consisting of deciduous and evergreen tree species mixtures. Microbial community composition, community-level physiological profiles, and respiration were evaluated using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and the MicroResp (TM) system, respectively. The relationship between tree species richness and glucose-induced respiration (GIR), basal respiration (BR), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) followed a positive but saturating shape. Microbial communities associated with species mixtures were more active (basal respiration [BR]), with higher biomass (glucose-induced respiration [GIR]), and used a greater number of carbon sources than monocultures. Communities associated with deciduous tree species used a greater number of carbon sources than those associated with evergreen species, suggesting a greater soil carbon storage capacity. There were no differences in microbial composition (PLFA) between monocultures and SR mixtures. The FD and the CWM of several functional traits affected both BR and GIR. In general, the CWM of traits had stronger effects than did FD, suggesting that certain traits of dominant species have more effect on ecosystem processes than does FD. Both the functions of GIR and BR were positively related to aboveground tree community productivity. Both tree diversity (SR) and identity (species and functional identityleaf habit) affected soil microbial community respiration, biomass, and composition. For the first time, we identified functional traits related to life-history strategy, as well as root traits that influence another trophic level, soil microbial community function, via effects on BR and GIR.

The objective of this study was to isolate efficient and PQQ-independent PSM. A total of 21 PSM were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of wheat and maize grown in the pots. Acinetobacter strains were the only PQQ-independent and most effective solubilizers of tricalcium phosphate containing agar. The mean P dissolved in liquid cultures of Acinetobacter strains in a 5-day incubation ranged from 167 to 888 mu g/ml P. The pH dropped to below 4.7 from 7.8 in six isolates, which produced gluconic acid in concentrations ranging between 27.5 and 37.5 mM. There was a linear regression between soluble P and gluconic acid concentrations in the bacterial cultures (P < 0.05; R (2) = 0.59). Inoculation with Acinetobacter sp. WR922 significantly (P < 0.05) increased wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) P content by 27% at 15 days after emergence (DAE) and dry matter by 15% at 30 DAE compared to the control. The plant P content in inoculated plants at 30 DAE was linearly correlated with soluble P of the bacterial cultures (P < 0.05; R (2) = 0.69). Gluconic acid production directly affected phosphate solubilization in vitro, which in turn influenced plant P content of inoculated plants in PQQ-independent P-solubilizing Acinetobacter strains.

This study was conducted to determine the varietal difference in ShB development and its association with yield loss across N rates. Two indica inbred and two indica/indica F-1 hybrid varieties were grown under 0 and 90 kg N ha(-1) in 2003 wet season (WS) and under 0, 75, 145, and 215 kg N ha(-1) in 2004 dry season (DS). Inoculation was done in 3.2 m(2) in each experiment unit to achieve uniform disease development. Disease intensity was quantified by measuring relative lesion height (RLH) and ShB index (ShBI) of inoculated 10 hills at flowering and 14 days after flowering. Plant traits, grain yield, temperature, and relative humidity inside the canopy were also measured. Consistent and significant varietal differences in ShB intensity were observed across N rates in both WS and DS. Among the four varieties, IR72 and IR75217H had higher RLH and ShBI than PSBRc52 and IR68284H at all N rates. Sheath blight index at 14 days after flowering had the closest correlation with yield loss from ShB. Varieties with taller stature, fewer tillers, and lower leaf N concentration such as IR68284H generally had lower RLH and ShBI, and consequently lower yield loss from the disease. Disease intensity and yield loss from ShB increased with increasing N rates, but the magnitude of yield loss varied among varieties. This suggests that fertilizer N should be managed more precisely and differently for varieties with different plant type in order to reduce the disease development and maximize grain yield in the irrigated rice systems.

Response of microbial community composition and function to soil climate change	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article							CALIFORNIA ANNUAL GRASSLAND; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; MODEL ECOSYSTEM; OLD-FIELD; DIVERSITY; CARBON; PLANT; OAK; MICROORGANISMS; TEMPERATURE	Soil microbial communities mediate critical ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycles. How microbial communities will respond to changes in vegetation and climate, however, are not well understood. We reciprocally transplanted soil cores from under oak canopies and adjacent open grasslands in a California oak-grassland ecosystem to determine how microbial communities respond to changes in the soil environment and the potential consequences for the cycling of carbon. Every 3 months for up to 2 years, we monitored microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA), microbial biomass, respiration rates, microbial enzyme activities, and the activity of microbial groups by quantifying C-13 uptake from a universal substrate (pyruvate) into PLFA biomarkers. Soil in the open grassland experienced higher maximum temperatures and lower soil water content than soil under the oak canopies. Soil microbial communities in soil under oak canopies were more sensitive to environmental change than those in adjacent soil from the open grassland. Oak canopy soil communities changed rapidly when cores were transplanted into the open grassland soil environment, but grassland soil communities did not change when transplanted into the oak canopy environment. Similarly, microbial biomass, enzyme activities, and microbial respiration decreased when microbial communities were transplanted from the oak canopy soils to the grassland environment, but not when the grassland communities were transplanted to the oak canopy environment. These data support the hypothesis that microbial community composition and function is altered when microbes are exposed to new extremes in environmental conditions; that is, environmental conditions outside of their life history envelopes.

In plants, there are usually more than 10 genes for each family and their members have been identified to be key regulators in many developmental and physiological processes controlling gametogenesis, embryogenesis, nodule development, seed development, abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, flowering time, primary root elongation, blue light responses, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and drought tolerance. Taking the advantages of the recent soybean genome draft and information on functional characterizations of nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) transcription factor family in plants, we identified 21 GmNF-YA, 32 GmNF-YB, and 15 GmNF-YC genes in the soybean (Glycine max) genome. Phylogenetic analyses show that soybean's proteins share strong homology to Arabidopsis and many of them are closely related to functionally characterized NF-Y in plants. Expression analysis in various tissues of flower, leaf, root, seeds of different developmental stages, root hairs under rhizobium inoculation, and drought-treated roots and leaves revealed that certain groups of soybean NF-Y are likely involved in specific developmental and stress responses. This study provides extensive evaluation of the soybean NF-Y family and is particularly useful for further functional characterization of GmNF-Y proteins in seed development, nodulation and drought adaptation of soybean.

A. Mayer) is affected by moisture, temperature, storage conditions and microbes. Several microbes were isolated from completely dehisced seed coat of ginseng cultivars, Chunpoong and Younpoong at Gumsan, Korea. We investigated the potential of five Talaromyces flavus isolates from the dehiscence of ginseng seed in four traditional stratification facilities. The isolates showed antagonistic activities against fungal plant pathogens, such as Cylindrocarpon destructans, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia nivalis, Botrytis cinerea, and Phytophthora capsici. The dehiscence ratios of ginseng seed increased more than 33% by treatment of E flavus GG01, GG02, GG04, GG12, and GG23 in comparison to control (28%). Among the treatments, the reformulating treatment of T flavus isolates GG01 and GG04 showed the highest of stratification ratio of ginseng seed. After 16 weeks, the reformulating treatment of T flavus isolates GG01 and GG04 significantly enhanced dehiscence of ginseng seed by about 81% compared to the untreated control. The candidate's treatment of E flavus GG01 and GG04 showed the highest decreasing rate of 93% in seed coat hardness for 112 days in dehiscence period. The results suggested that the pre-inoculation of T flavus GG01 and GG04 found to be very effective applications in improving dehiscence and germination of ginseng seed.

In this research the influence of ethanol impregnation on drying rate and quality of dried apples were evaluated. Before drying, apple cubes were dipped in aqueous solutions of ethanol at different level of concentration, for different times. Fruit pieces, raw or pre-treated, were air-dried in a cabinet and in a suction-flow pi lot plant under standardised process conditions. In all dried samples, water content, colour, microbial load and residual content of ethanol were determined. The results showed that pre-treatments in ethanol solutions remarkably increase the drying rate and cause a reduction of polyphenoloxidase activity, resulting in a lower level of browning in pre-treated dried apple cubes. Moreover in samples dipped in solutions with contents of ethanol of 20 and 40% by weight, it has been detected a residual ethanol value lower than 4%.

Seedling and adult plant resistance as quantitative traits	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article						quantitative genetics; North Carolina mating design II; adult plant; blackleg resistance; Brassica napus; Leptosphaeria maculans	OILSEED RAPE; GERMINATION; CAMPESTRIS; RESPONSES; INFECTION; CULTIVARS; LEAVES	Inheritance studies of seedling and adult-plant resistance to blackleg [Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces, et De Not.] in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) were conducted using 49 families derived by intercrosses between 14 randomly chosen F2 plants from the cross cv ''Maluka'' (resistant) cv ''Niklas'' (susceptible), conforming to the North Carolina mating design II (NCR I-IT). Four concurrent experiments were performed, where plants from each family were: (I) Spray inoculated with a 10(5) pycnidiospores/ml suspension 10 days after germination and assessed 2-weeks later for cotyledon-lesion development, (EI) As for (I), but assessed 12 weeks after inoculation for crown-canker development, (III) Wound-inoculated on the stems at growth stage 2.4-2.5 on the Harper and Berkenkamp scale and assessed for crown-canker development 5 weeks after inoculation, and (IV) Spray inoculated at growth stage 2.3-2.4 with a 10(5) pycnidiospores/ml suspension and assessed for crown-canker development nine weeks after inoculation. A L. maculans isolate possessing high levels of host specificity (MB2) was used in all inoculations. Seedling resistance was evaluated using a 0-5 cotyledon-lesion severity scale. Adult-plant resistance/susceptibility was evaluated using three separate measures of crown-canker size, i.e. the percentage of crown girdled (%G), external lesion length (E) and internal lesion area (%II). Quantitative genetic analysis of blackleg resistance using the NCM-II design revealed significant non-additive genetic variances for all measures of disease severity, in all four experiments, indicating the presence of strong dominance/epistasis at loci controlling blackleg resistance. The resistance to crown-canker development, after wound-inoculation of the stem, was found to possess the highest ratio of additive to non-additive genetic variance. Crown-canker development in mature plants of the NCM-II population was not related to the degree of cotyledon-lesion development at the seedling stage, indicating the limited value of the cotyledon test in screening for adult-plant blackleg resistance. The implications of these findings to breeding for resistance to blackleg in rapeseed are discussed.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization and phosphorus nutrition in organic field pea and lentil	MYCORRHIZA			English	Article						Organic; Seeding rate; Field pea; Lentil; Phosphorus (P); Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)	NORTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; OPTIMAL SEEDING RATE; SOIL FERTILITY; CROPPING SYSTEMS; NUTRIENT-UPTAKE; FARMING SYSTEMS; PLANT-GROWTH; N-2 FIXATION; CROPS; YIELD	Phosphorus (P) can be low in soil under low input organic management; however, beneficial crop plant associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to promote crop nutrition and increase phosphorus uptake. Thus, management strategies that promote AMF associations are particularly desirable for low-input cropping systems. The objectives of this study were to determine the impact of seeding rate on AMF colonization and the impact of AMF colonization on P concentration and uptake by organically grown field pea and lentil. Field experiments examined the impact of three seeding rates of field pea and lentil on P uptake and crop yield. Phosphorus accumulation was examined further in a controlled growth chamber experiment, in which field pea was sown at rates corresponding to those used in the field and harvested at 10-day intervals until 50 days after emergence. In the field, the level of AMF colonization of roots remained at 80% for field pea, while colonization of lentil increased with increasing seeding rates from 77% to 88%. The level of AMF colonization of field pea achieved in the growth chamber after 50 days was 80% for the two highest seeding rates and 60% for the low seeding rate. The rate at which AMF colonization occurred did not vary between treatments. Ultimately, AMF colonization level did not affect P accumulation. In contrast to several previous studies, both field and growth chamber experiments revealed that AMF colonization was not reduced at higher seeding rates. These results suggest that organic farmers may increase seeding rates without adversely affecting P nutrition.

Essential oils were extracted from mint, savory, thyme, cinnamon and lavender and then analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Carvacrol (71.2%) and thymol (73.3%) were the main components in savory and thyme. The main chemical compounds in mint oil were menthone (33.8%) and menthol (36.1%). cis-cinnamaldehyde (59.1%) was the main constituent of cinnamon oil, whereas linalyl acetate (43.1%) and linalool (26.3%) were the key compounds in lavender oil. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primer confirmed the identity of the C. gloeosporiodes isolate. In-situ antifungal activity was assayed by artificially inoculating avocado fruit with C. gloeosporioides then applying essential oils to the fruit at concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 percent. After four weeks of storage, savory and thyme oils applied at 2000 ppm exhibited the strongest antifungal activity, reducing expansion of necrotic lesions around the inoculation sites on the fruit by 58-64%. Savory and thyme oils also considerably decreased (54-67%) lesion expansion. The results of a fruit firmness assay showed that savory and thyme oils applied at 500-2000 ml L-1 resulted in fruit that were 2.5-3.3 times firmer than the non-treated controls, whereas other oils applied at 500 ml L-1 did not help maintain fruit firmness. Disease severity and fruit firmness variables were quadratically related to savory oil concentration. This study confirms the potential for using savory and thyme essential oils as biological fungicides for increasing the storage time of avocado fruit. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enzymatic activity and culturable bacteria diversity in rhizosphere of amaranth, as indicators of crop phenological changes	BOTANICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Amaranthus hypochondriacus; dehydrogenase; phosphatase; rhizosheath; semi-arid soil; soil organic carbon	SOIL; COMMUNITY; ADHESION; ABILITY; STRAIN	Background: Amaranth is a plant of interest in farming due to its ability to adapt into arid and semi-and climates.Biological activity by microorganisms in rhizosphere determines plant performance and quality. Hypothesis: The enzymatic activity is different in two types of soil, rhizosheath soil (adhered by roots) and loose soil (non-adhered by roots), in four cropping periods of amaranth. Species study: Amaranthus hypochondriacus L. Methods: Parameters of soil organic matter and several enzyme activities in the amaranth rhizosphere were assessed. Two types of soil, rhizosheath soil and loose soil, and four cropping periods were compared. Thirty-seven culturable bacterial isolates obtained from rhizosheath soil were molecularly identified. Results: Rhizosheath soil had higher content of carbon and total nitrogen compared with loose soil; however, potential enzyme activity in both soil types was similar. Dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activities were very sensitive to the crop phenological stages. Acid and alkaline phosphatases, cellulase and protease activities correlated to changes in soil moisture. The greatest diversity of culturable bacteria was found during the flowering stage. Conclusions: In the rhizosphere of A. hypochondriacus grown in a pumiceous sandy soil, enzymatic activities in the rhizosheath and loose soils were similar, which must be considered a unique rhizosphere environment. Dehydrogenase and acid phosphatase activities were highly sensitive to changes in the crop phenology. The behavior of phosphatases and dehydrogenase activities suggests an increased dynamic soil organic matter (SOM) during the post-harvest period. In the amaranth rhizosphere, native culturable bacteria are involved in the breakdown of SOM.

Response of Tallgrass Prairie to Management in the US Southern Great Plains: Site Descriptions, Management Practices, and Eddy Covariance Instrumentation for a Long-Term Experiment	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						global positioning system; interacting effects; remote sensing; unmanned aerial systems; vegetation phenology	CARBON-DIOXIDE EXCHANGE; GRAZING MANAGEMENT; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; WINTER-WHEAT; FLUXES; VARIABILITY; NITROGEN; CATTLE; WATER; CO2	Understanding the consequences of different management practices on vegetation phenology, forage production and quality, plant and microbial species composition, greenhouse gas emissions, and water budgets in tallgrass prairie systems is vital to identify best management practices. As part of the Southern Plains Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (SP-LTAR) grassland study, a long-term integrated Grassland-LivestOck Burning Experiment (iGLOBE) has been established with a cluster of six eddy covariance (EC) systems on differently managed (i.e., different burning and grazing regimes) native tallgrass prairie systems located in different landscape positions. The purpose of this paper is to describe this long-term experiment, report preliminary results on the responses of differently managed tallgrass prairies under variable climates using satellite remote sensing and EC data, and present future research directions. In general, vegetation greened-up and peaked early, and produced greater forage yields in burned years. However, drought impacts were greater in burned sites due to reductions in soil water availability by burning. The impact of grazing on vegetation phenology was confounded by several factors (e.g., cattle size, stocking rate, precipitation). Moreover, prairie systems located in different landscapes responded differently, especially in dry years due to differences in water availability. The strong correspondence between vegetation phenology and eddy fluxes was evidenced by strong linear relationships of a greenness index (i.e., enhanced vegetation index) with evapotranspiration and gross primary production. Results indicate that impacts of climate and management practices on vegetation phenology may profoundly impact carbon and water budgets of tallgrass prairie. Interacting effects of multiple management practices and inter-annual climatic variability on the responses of tallgrass prairie highlight the necessity of establishing an innovative and comprehensive long-term experiment to address inconsistent responses of tallgrass prairie to different intensities, frequencies, timing, and duration of management practices, and to identify best management practices.

Therefore, a K-strategic fungivorus nematode, Tylencholaimus parvus, was examined for population growth rates on nine fungal species on agar and on soil-based media. Also, the nematode was compared with an r-strategic fungivorus nematode, Aphelenchus avenae, in terms of population growth rates on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and of prey-predator relationships with nematophagus fungi, Pleurotus spp., growing on water agar. Population Growth rates of T. parvus on PDA were large on three plant-pathogenic fungi, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum and Phoma herbarum. On the soil-based medium, two saprophytic fungi, Coprinus cinereus and Flammulina velutipes, also supported large population increases of the nematode, as well as F. oxysporum and P. herbarum. Tylencholaimus parvus always had significantly smaller growth rates than A. avenae, and the rates of T parvus were 0-24% of those of A. avenae on a given fungal species. Tylencholaimus parvus was able to avoid predation of the two Pleurotus species and fed upon the fungal hyphae to reproduce, although A. avenae was killed and consumed by the fungi.

Understanding the community structure of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in response to N management can be of great ecological significance, particularly with the recent emphasis on the role of AMF in N cycling. A comprehensive study of both the vertical distribution of AMF in the soil profile and the temporal changes in community structure in maize roots was conducted over a 5-year period at a field site on the North China Plain. The N treatments consisted of zero N, conventional farming practice, and optimum N based on an in-season soil N-min test. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and clone sequencing were used to analyse the AMF community. Optimum N mitigated the decline in richness of AMF in the conventional N treatment in the surface soil. Diverse and species-rich AMF communities occurred deep in the soil profile. A significant difference in AMF community structure was observed between the control and fertilizer N treatments but not between the two N application strategies. AMF communities deeper in the soil profile were subsets of those richer communities in the surface soil and the loss of AMF taxa was mostly due to the absence of rare taxa. Soil pH and N-min contents were major soil properties affecting the soil AMF communities among the N treatments while vertical distribution was influenced mainly by soil electrical conductivity. Crop phenology had a stronger influence than N treatment on the temporal shifts in AMF communities in maize roots. Our results provide evidence for the importance of N management in maintaining AMF diversity. Changes in soil chemical properties due to N fertilization, in particular declining soil pH, should be integrated in N management strategies to reduce the negative impacts on AMF communities induced by N fertilization. Excessive N inputs induced significant changes in soil physicochemical properties, especially soil acidification, and may have negative impacts on AMF communities.

An experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions, with three treatments consisting of Gigaspora margarita, Glomus etunicatum, Glomus clarum in single inoculation, and four treatments composed by the combination of these species, Gigaspora margarita + Glomus clarum, Gigaspora margarita + Glomus etunicatum, Glomus clarum + Glomus etunicatum and Gigaspora margarita + Glomus etunicatum + Glomus clarum. All treatments with the fungal inoculum were evaluated without addition of phosphorus in the substrate. In comparison, three treatment controls were used (without fungus) containing three levels of phosphorus: 0, 50 and 100 mg dm(-3), performing ten treatments. The experimental design was in random blocks with five replicates. After 140 days of germination, it was observed that all species of AMF inoculated alone or in combination, led to significant benefits on growth, nutrition and production of phenolic compounds in Australian red cedar seedlings in soils containing low phosphorus availability. The mixture in the soil of Gigaspora margarita, Glomus etunicatum and Glomus clarum was able to provide significant increases in plant growth in most parameters assessed, resulting in performance equivalent or higher than non-mycorrhizal and control plants grown in soil fertilized with phosphorus. This suggests that AMF can promote reduction in phosphorus addition during the production of Australian red cedar seedlings.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can increase a number of plant traits to which pollinating insects are known to respond. These include total plant size, flower number, flower size, and amount of pollen produced. 2. It was hypothesised that these effects would lead to a different visitation rate of pollinating insects on mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. To test this idea, three species of annual plants (Centaurea cyanus, Tagetes erecta, and Tagetes patula) were grown with and without AM fungi and the visits by pollinating insects were recorded over a 2-month period. 3. In all three species, mycorrhizal plants experienced a greater number of pollinator visits per flower per unit time. Diptera and Hymenoptera were the predominant insects and the latter order showed the strongest response. 4. Here, it is suggested that mycorrhizal fungi increase floral visitation rates by insects, but that the mechanism varies from one plant species to another. In C. cyanus, it appears to be due to flower number per plant, in T. patula it is individual inflorescence size, and in T. patula it is nectar standing crop per inflorescence.

Effects of Seed Priming with Gibberellic, Salicylic Acids and Mycorrhizal Inoculation on Lentil (Lens culinaris L.) Yield and its Components	LEGUME RESEARCH			English	Article						Combination treatments; Harvest index; Hydro priming; Pod number	GERMINATION; TOLERANCE; STRESS; GROWTH; SALINITY; BARLEY; IMPACT; SALT	A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of mycorrhizal inoculation and seed priming with plant growth regulators on yield and yield components of lentil as factorial base on the randomized complete block design in four replications at the research farm of Gonbad Kavous University of Iran during 2013-2014. First factor included application of the mycorrhiza at three levels (control, inoculated soil using Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae) and seed priming at five levels (hydro-priming with distilled water, seed priming with GA3 100 ppm, priming with SA 100 ppm, priming with GA3 100 ppm + SA 100 ppm and non-primed seed as control was the second factor. On the basis of results, days to 50% flowering was significantly decreased with the application of mycorrhizal inoculation along whole treatments of priming except G. mosseae in combination with both hormones level. It was also observed that combined treatments of Glomus intraradical inoculation with hydro priming caused most early flowering, the number of pods in the plant, ratio of the filled pod, grain weight of lentil eventually higher yields and harvest index of lentil over other treatments. Thus mycorrhizal inoculation can help to minimize synthetic herbicides and develop biofertilizer in sustainable agriculture.	[Azarnia, M.; Biabani, A.; Alamdari, E.

HULL; INFECTION; ESTABLISHMENT; RESTORATION; VISITATION; MANAGEMENT	We hypothesized that the contrasting soil conditions resulting from different historical land use in heathlands mediate the interactions of Calluna vulgaris with pollinators. We compared using a common garden experiment, the flowering phenology, the interaction with pollinators, and the colonization by ericoid mycorrhiza of mature C. vulgaris on three types of soils namely: (1) natural rhizospheric soil collected in a natural heath, (2) soil from an arable land recently restored into a heathland, and (3) soil of C. vulgaris from an area in which a high degree of heterospecific competition with perennial grasses occurred. The results of the experiment showed a strong effect of soil on flower phenology and synchrony. There was also an interaction with pollinators because not only did visitation rates depend on soil provenance but also the choice of plant by the pollinator, at least for honeybees, was affected by soil provenance. An a posteriori correlation analysis suggests that ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and not abiotic conditions across the different soil provenances may be involved in the interaction between plants and pollinators. The results obtained from this study highlight the importance of soil processes to understand plantpollinator interactions and point at plantsoil feedbacks as an important mechanism for understanding heathland ecology.

Begomoviruses have a complex association with their whitefly vector. To further understand these relationships, fecundity and life history parameters of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) were compared on 5, 20, 35 d post inoculated (DPI), CLCuV infected and healthy cotton plants to determine the effect of virus on its vector. Cotton leaf curl virus infection increased percent egg viability of B. tabaci. Whiteflies deposited significantly fewer eggs on virus infected plants compared to healthy plants. The development time of whiteflies from egg to adulthood was significantly reduced on CLCuV infected plants with shorter nymphal and pupal duration. Male and female whiteflies had shorter longevity on CLCuV infected plants compared with healthy plants. The egg duration was similar on CLCuV infected and healthy plants regardless of DPI of plants.

The reproductive phenology of Acaena elongata and its relation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	SYMBIOSIS			English	Article						Anthropogenic perturbation; Colonization; Flowering; Fruiting; Mutualism	DARK SEPTATE ENDOPHYTES; DECIDUOUS FOREST; COLONIZATION; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; ROOTS; WEED; PLANTS; TRAITS; GROWTH	Plant sexual reproduction is an energetic process since it requires large amounts of resource allocation for flower and fruit production. Therefore, the establishment of a mutualism with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can increase the plant's reproductive success. Acaena elongata is a native weed and a plant species indicator of anthropogenic perturbations in the understory of Abies religiosa forests of the Magdalena river basin in Mexico City. The aim of this work was to assess whether: i) there are temporal and spatial variations in AM fungal root colonization in A. elongata, ii) AM fungal root colonization is linked to A. elongata flower and fruit production patterns, and iii) AM fungal root colonization, spore abundance and richness, and A. elongata reproductive phenology are related to soil variables. Eight plots were established with five randomly selected individuals of A. elongata. Over the course of 1 year, the A. elongata reproductive phenology, environmental temperature, and relative soil moisture were registered monthly. Additionally, root samplings for AM fungal colonization and soil for determining the AM fungal spore abundance and richness were carried out during the rainy and dry seasons. The mean total AM fungal root colonization percentage was higher in the dry season (78 +/- S.E. 11.09%) than in the rainy season (71 +/- S.E. 13.2%); A. elongata showed reproductive structures throughout the year, with negative significant correlations between colonization and some phenological phases during the rainy season. Flower and fruit production as well as AM fungal root colonization were related to variations in the abiotic variables in each season and population. This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between AM fungi and a plant species indicator of anthropogenic perturbations.

Apantu-pa in microplots in Ghana. Hot water treated suckers, planted in 31 plastic bags containing sterilised soil, were inoculated 1 month after planting with a single nematode species or a nematode species mixture; controls were not inoculated. The initial single species inocula consisted of 1000 or 10 000 nematodes per plant, whilst the initial species mixture inoculum consisted of 3000 nematodes of each nematode species per plant. Two months after planting, the suckers were transplanted into micro-plots (0.7 m(3) concrete containers filled with sterilised soil). Inoculation of single species at either density resulted in lower (P less than or equal to 0.05) bunch weights of the mother plants (between 23-33% lower) than the non-inoculated control plants, whilst bunch weights of plants inoculated with the species mixture were 18% lower (P less than or equal to 0.05). Nematode damage indices (% dead roots, root necrosis and sucker corm lesions) were more severe in P. coffeae inoculated treatments. There was no difference between inoculated treatments and the control in plant growth parameters (days to flowering, number of standing leaves, height, girth, number of suckers) of the mother plant at flowering and harvest. Plant toppling occurred only in, and in all, treatments involving P. coffeae, with up to 60% of bunch-carrying plants toppled in the most affected treatment (inoculation of 10 000 nematodes per plant). Therefore, projected yields per ha were low in P. coffeae inoculated treatments: 41, 73 and 65% lower than the control for inoculation of 1000, 10 000 and 3000 (in species mixture) individuals, respectively. Inoculation with 10 000 H. multicinctus or M. javanica per plant resulted in yield losses of 26 and 30%, respectively. This study suggests that P. coffeae is likely to be the most important biotic constraint to plantain production in Ghana. Nematodes have been viewed as the major biotic constraint to plantain production in the country, and P. coffeae is the most widespread and abundant nematode species on plantain in Ghana. The results further demonstrate that H. multicinctus and M. javanica can cause considerable yield reduction in plantain.

Seven and fourteen days after germination seedlings were infected with Agro bacterium rhizogenes strain ARqua1 either by direct coating of the cut radicles with bacteria growing on solid medium or by immersion of the cut surface in bacterial suspension at different optical densities. Both methods of infection resulted in production of GFP-positive roots with a frequency ranging from 6 to 20% according to the age of the explants and the application procedure. The green fluorescing roots displayed the typical hairy root phenotype and were easily maintained in liquid medium without growth regulators for over 2 years. Stable expression of the transgene in the roots was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoblotting and the capacity of roots to grow and produce callus on kanamycin-enriched medium. Nineteen endogenous cytokinins were determined in transgenic and non-transformed roots. The results revealed significantly lower levels of the free bases of isopentenyladenine, dihydrozeatin, cis- and trans-zeatin, as well as a conspicuous decline in concentrations of the corresponding nucleosides and most nucleotides in transgenic roots compared to the wild type. Comparison of the cytokinin profiles in transgenic and non-transformed roots suggested that transformation by A. rhizogenes disturbed cytokinin metabolism during the early steps of biosynthesis.

AS AFFECTED BY INOCULATION WITH PLANT GROWTH-PROMOTING BACTERIA	BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL			Portuguese	Article						Burkholderia; Pseudomonas; Rhizobium; Inoculation	PSEUDOMONAS-PUTIDA; RHIZOBACTERIA; YIELD; ENHANCEMENT	Aiming to evaluate the effect of the inoculation of six strains of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPBs) Burkholderia spp. (B7 and B16), Pseudomonas spp. (P18 and P21) and Rhizobium spp. (R65 and R82) and two mixtures containing one strain of each genera on the growth of six rice cultivars (BRS Bonanca, BRS Aimore, BRS Talento, BRSMG Curinga, Japones and Bolinha). Physiological characteristics of the bacteria were determined on in vitro assays. Rice cultivars were inoculated with PGPB under greenhouse conditions and cultivated on 1 kg pots filled with soil on a randomized block design with four replicates. At 60 days after emergence growth parameters related with the shoot and root were evaluated for rice cultivars. Among the evaluated bacteria only two (B7 and R65) were not able to produce auxin under in vitro conditions. All strains showed catalase activity and film formation in semisolid medium NFb without N or nodulation in common bean, indicating the ability of biological nitrogen fixation. Inoculation of PGPBs in rice provided increases of 10% as compared to the control regarding leaf area and dry mass of shoots and 9% for length and root dry weight. Among the cultivars BRS Aimore showed greater interaction with the strains studied and the strain P21 of Pseudomonas spp. promoted significant difference compared to the control for the parameters related with the shoot and root system.

Fungal endophytes enhance wheat heat and drought tolerance in terms of grain yield and second-generation seed viability	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						drought; fungal endophytes; germination; heat; tolerance; wheat	CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; TRITICUM-AESTIVUM; DNA-METHYLATION; SPRING WHEAT; PLANT; STRESS; GERMINATION; EXPRESSION; ASSOCIATION	AimsWe evaluated the impact of fungal endophyte symbiosis on the growth, ecophysiological and reproductive success of wheat exposed to heat and drought. Methods and ResultsThe resistance of pot-grown wheat to heat or drought stress was measured by quantifying efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), plant height, average seed weight (ASW), total seed weight (TSW), water-use efficiency (WUE) as well as time to 50% germination and percentage germination of second-generation seeds produced under heat stress, drought stress or well-watered conditions. The endophytic fungi tested increased wheat tolerance for drought and heat. Endophyte SMCD 2206 was the most beneficial, followed by SMCD 2210 and 2215. Surprisingly, second-generation seeds produced by drought-stressed wheat colonized by SMCD 2206, 2210 or 2215 had decreased WUE relative to those produced by endophyte-free, drought-stressed plants. However, these seeds germinated more rapidly than those produced by endophyte-free, stressed parental plants. ConclusionsThe tested consortium of endophytes has the potential to improve wheat adaptation to heat and drought. Significance and Impact of the StudyThe capacity of endophytes to increase wheat tolerance for abiotic stress and to improved germination in endophyte-free second-generation seeds arising from stressed plants could be applicable to agriculture. The mechanisms by which intergenerational endophyte-mediated affects occurs warrant further research.

Resistance was quantified by the whitefly life history components adult survival, oviposition rate, pre-adult survival and developmental period, measured on plants inoculated with whiteflies in clip-on cages. The largest differences between species were found when life history components were measured on adult plants of about four months old. On L. hirsutum f. glabratum whiteflies had the lowest adult survival, oviposition rate and pre-adult survival. On L. hirsutum these components were intermediate whereas on all L. esculentum genotypes they were highest. The variation between plants was low compared to the variation within plants. These results indicate that single plant tests can be used to determine accurately genetic variation between individual plants in a segregating population.

Do plant-microbe interactions support the Stress Gradient Hypothesis?	ECOLOGY			English	Article						facilitation; Florida rosemary scrub; habitat specialization; plant-microbe interactions; soil microbes; Stress Gradient Hypothesis; symbiosis	FACILITATION; FIRE; COMPETITION; COMMUNITIES; STRATEGIES; ELEVATION	The Stress Gradient Hypothesis (SGH), which predicts increasing ratios of facilitative:competitive interactions with increasing stress, has long been a guiding framework for conceptualizing plant-plant interactions. Recently, there has been a growing recognition of the roles of microbes in mitigating or exacerbating environmental stress for their plant hosts. As such, we might predict, based on the SGH, that beneficial microbial effects on plant performance should be positively associated with stress. Specifically, we hypothesized that support for the SGH would depend on the host plant's habitat specialization such that species that specialize in high stress habitats and thus likely coevolved with the resident microbes would exhibit stronger support for the SGH than non-specialist plant species. We further hypothesized that support for the SGH would vary with germination frequency, since boosting germination of low-frequency germinators is one effective means by which microbes can benefit plant species performance. Here, we explore whether plant-microbial interactions support the SGH using 12 plant species native to the Florida rosemary scrub. We conducted factorial experiments that manipulated the presence of microbes in nine soils collected along an elevational stress gradient, and recorded germination frequency and biomass. Microbes increased the germination frequency of four species, all of which had relatively low germination rates. Furthermore, we found support for the SGH in nearly one-half of the species examined, with soil microbes facilitating germination with increasing stress for 5 of the 12 species tested, and none of the species exhibiting the opposite trend. Support for the SGH was not predicted by either the plant hosts' habitat specialization or germination frequency. In contrast to germination, biomass results showed little support for the SGH, with four of 12 species refuting and one species supporting SGH predictions. Taken together, our study documents that interactions between the soil microbial community and plant species along a stress gradient can support the SGH, but emphasizes that these effects are life-history-stage dependent. This work also identifies a common mechanism (germination facilitation) by which microbes can benefit plant species in stressful habitats.

Plants inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 were grown in Leonard jars under controlled conditions, with P-deficient (0 and 0.1 mM), P-medium (0.5, 1 and 1.5 mM) and P-high (2 mM) conditions in a N-free nutrient solution. The P application, increased leaf area, whole plant DW (67%), nodule biomass (4-fold), and shoot and root P content (4- and 6-fold, respectively) in plant harvested at the onset of flowering (28-days-old). However, P treatments decreased the total soluble sugar and amino acid content in vegetative organs (leaf, root and nodules). The root growth proved less sensitive to P deficiency than did shoot growth, and the leaf area was significantly reduced at low P-application. The absence of a relationship between shoot N content, and P levels in the growth medium could indicate that nitrogen fixation requires more P than does plant growth. The optimal amount for the P. vulgaris-R. tropici CIAT899 symbiosis was 1.5 mM P, this treatment augmented nodule-ARA 20-fold, and ARA per plant 70-fold compared with plants without P application.

Results from agronomic field support this line of reasoning but recent studies have shown more variable results in natural systems. We investigated how high and low nutrient and water treatments affected biomass allocation patterns of endophyte-infected and uninfected Festuca pratensis and F. rubra in greenhouse experiments over two growing seasons. Irrespective of infection status, both grass species showed improved performance on highly fertilized and watered soils. However, infected F. pratensis plants produced larger tillers than endophyte-free plants on soil low in nutrients and water in the first growing season, although they (E +) otherwise showed decreased performance on nutrient-poor soil. In low nutrient and water conditions, endophyte-infected plants produced less tillers and had lower total biomass compared to uninfected plants, and displayed a negative phenotypic correlation between seed production and vegetative growth. The latter indicates costs of reproduction when the plant shares common resources with the fungal endophyte. However, endophyte infection status (E +, E -) interacted significantly with the soil fertilisation in terms of plant growth, having a stronger positive effect on growth in infected F. pratensis plants. In F. rubro, endophyte-infected plants showed higher vegetative growth in fertilized and watered soils compared to uninfected plants. However, infected plants tended to produce fewer inflorescences, This had no effect on seed production, perhaps because seed production was partly replaced by asexual pseudovivipary. Contrary to the general assumption in the literature that fungal endophytes are plant mutualists, these findings suggest that the costs of endophytes may outweigh their benefits in resource limited conditions. However, the costs of endophyte infections appear to differ among the grass species studied; costs of endophytes were mainly detected in F. pratensis under low nutrient conditions. We propose that differences in response to endophyte infection in these species may depend on the differences in life-history strategies and environmental requirements of these two fescue and fungal species and may change during the life span of the plant.

Presumed jumps to new hosts and subsequent somatic hybridizations appear to be common among epichloid endophytes resulting in increased genetic variation upon which selection can act and speciation be initiated. In this study, we explored the endophyte diversity of a rare European native woodland grass species, Hordelymus europaeus, along a latitudinal transect covering the entire distribution range of H. europaeus. From 28 populations in six countries, isolates were sampled and molecularly characterized. Based on the sequences of tubB and tefA, six distinct epichloid taxa (interspecific hybrid or cryptic haploid species) were found, of which four were novel and two have been previously reported from this host. Of the novel endophytes, two were presumed to be interspecific hybrids and two of nonhybrid origin. While previously known endophytes of H. europaeus are seed-born and strictly asexual, one of the novel nonhybrid endophytes found in the glacial refugium of the Apennine peninsula reproduced sexually in cultured plants. This is the first case of a seed-borne, but sexually reproducing endophyte of this host. We discuss the origin, and possible ancestral species, of the six epichloid taxa using phylogenetic analyses. Repeated host jumps and somatic hybridizations characterize the diversity of the endophytes. To date, no other grass species is known to host a larger diversity of endophytes than H. europaeus.

SITE OF INOCULATION AND STAGE OF PLANT DEVELOPMENT DETERMINE SYMPTOM TYPE AND EXPRESSION IN BRASSICA JUNCEA FOLLOWING INFECTION WITH ALBUGO CANDIDA	JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						White blister rust; symptom expression; pod hypertrophy; staghead	INDIAN MUSTARD; RESISTANCE; AUSTRALIA; GERMPLASM; CHINA	Investigations were carried out firstly to determine if there were any differences in symptom expression following spot inoculation of the cotyledons, leaf lamina or the growth apex at different stages of plant growth and, secondly, to determine the specific reproductive stage during development of Brassica juncea at which the flowers have to be inoculated with Albugo candida to maximise development of pod hypertrophies. Spot and growing point inoculations performed at the cotyle-donary or true leaf stages caused clear differences in disease progression and severity of disease occurring at subsequent stages of plant growth. In this test, inoculations of only the growing points at the true leaf stage [GS 2.1] resulted in systemic pod hypertrophies. However, among the different reproductive stages tested, only inoculations of flower buds just changing colour [GS 3.3] or just opening flowers [GS 4.1] resulted in pod hypertrophies. Earlier or later inoculations of flower buds or flowers failed to result in pod hypertrophies. These studies have defined, for the first time, the particular reproductive stages of plant development at which infection results in pod hypertrophies. They have also shown that, in relation to infections of shoot tissues, it is the inoculation of the growing point at the first true leaf stage that leads to systemic development of the disease, rather than inoculations of cotyledons or leaf laminae. The findings of this study indicate that fungicide applications, targeting these critical stages of early plant development, and the associated plant sites, and also flower buds changing colour and/or just opening, present the best opportunities for arresting infections that lead to systemic spread of the pathogen within the plant, thus minimizing the extent and severity of both leaf disease and pod deformations. These studies provide a basis for subsequent identification of the mechanisms controlling the systemic spread of A. candida within B. juncea. Once identified, such mechanisms could be exploited in developing and deploying new cultivars with improved resistance against both white rust leaf disease and pod hypertrophies.

J	593		Schmidt, S; Stewart, GR				Schmidt, S; Stewart, GR			delta N-15 values of tropical savanna and monsoon forest species reflect root specialisations and soil nitrogen status	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						N-15 natural abundance; fire; mycorrhiza; Monsoon forest; Savanna	N-15 NATURAL-ABUNDANCE; NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; FOLIAR DELTA-N-15; RAINFALL GRADIENT; PLANT; TREES; NITRATE; DISCRIMINATION; AVAILABILITY; VEGETATION	A large number of herbaceous and woody plants from tropical woodland, savanna, and monsoon forest were analysed to determine the impact of environmental factors (nutrient and water availability, fire) and biological factors (microbial associations, systematics) on plant delta(15)N values. Foliar delta(15)N values of herbaceous and woody species were not related to growth form or phenology, but a strong relationship existed between mycorrhizal status and plant delta(15)N. In woodland and savanna, woody species with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations and putative N-2-fixing species with ECM/arbuscular (AM) associations had lowest foliar delta(15)N values (1.0-0.6parts per thousand), AM species had mostly intermediate delta(15)N values (average +0.6parts per thousand), while non-mycorrhizal Proteaceae had highest delta(15)N values (+2.9 to +4.1parts per thousand). Similar differences in foliar delta(15)N were observed between AM (average 0.1 and 0.2parts per thousand) and non-mycorrhizal (average +0.8 and +0.3parts per thousand) herbaceous species in woodland and savanna. Leguminous savanna species had significantly higher leaf N contents (1.8-2.5% N) than non-fixing species (0.9-1.2% N) indicating substantial N acquisition via N-2 fixation. Monsoon forest species had similar leaf N contents (average 2.4% N) and positive delta(15)N values (+0.9 to +2.4parts per thousand). Soil nitrification and plant NO3- use was substantially higher in monsoon forest than in woodland or savanna. In the studied communities, higher soil N content and nitrification rates were associated with more positive soil delta(15)N and plant delta(15)N. In support of this notion, Ficus, a high NO3- using taxa associated with NO3- rich sites in the savanna, had the highest delta(15)N values of all AM species in the savanna. delta(15)N of xylem sap was examined as a tool for studying plant delta(15)N relations. delta(15)N of xylem sap varied seasonally and between differently aged Acacia and other savanna species. Plants from annually burnt savanna had significantly higher delta(15)N values compared to plants from less frequently burnt savanna, suggesting that foliar N-15 natural abundance could be used as marker for assessing historic fire regimes. Australian woodland and savanna species had low leaf delta(15)N and N content compared to species from equivalent African communities indicating that Australian biota are the more N depauperate. The largest differences in leaf delta(15)N occurred between the dominant ECM Australian and African savanna (miombo) species, which were depleted and enriched in N-15, respectively. While the depleted delta(15)N of Australian ECM species are similar to those of previous reports on ECM species in natural plant communities, the N-15-enriched delta(15)N of African ECM species represent an anomaly.

However, the available data on competitive ability in dioecious plants are scarce and contradictory. In this study sexual competition was evaluated using the dioecious plant Antennaria dioica in a common garden transplantation experiment. Methods Male and female plants were grown for 3 years either in isolation, or in competition with a plant of the same sex or the opposite sex. Flowering phenology, sexual and asexual reproduction, plant growth, nutrient content and arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in the roots were assessed. Key Results Our results showed little evidence of sexual differences in competitive ability. Both sexes suffered similarly from competition, and competitive effects were manifested in some traits related to fitness but not in others. Survival was unaffected by competition, but competing plants reduced their vegetative growth and reproductive investment compared with non-competing plants. In addition, differences in sexual competitive ability were observed in relation to flowering frequency, an important life history trait not reported in previous studies. Conclusions The findings indicate that female and male A. dioica plants possess similar intersexual competitive abilities which may be related to the similar costs of reproduction between sexes in this species. Nevertheless, intrasexual competition is higher in females, giving support for asymmetric niche segregation between the sexes.

Aflatoxin Accumulation in a Maize Diallel Cross	AGRICULTURE-BASEL			English	Article						Aspergillus flavus; aflatoxin; maize; plant resistance	ASPERGILLUS-FLAVUS; GERMPLASM LINE; INSECT DAMAGE; REGISTRATION; CORN; CONTAMINATION; RESISTANCE; MYCOTOXINS; GEORGIA; MP313E	Aflatoxins, produced by the fungus Aspergillus flavus, occur naturally in maize. Contamination of maize grain with aflatoxin is a major food and feed safety problem and greatly reduces the value of the grain. Plant resistance is generally considered a highly desirable approach to reduction or elimination of aflatoxin in maize grain. In this investigation, a diallel cross was produced by crossing 10 inbred lines with varying degrees of resistance to aflatoxin accumulation in all possible combinations. Three lines that previously developed and released as sources of resistance to aflatoxin accumulation were included as parents. The 10 parental inbred lines and the 45 single crosses making up the diallel cross were evaluated for aflatoxin accumulation in field tests conducted in 2013 and 2014. Plants were inoculated with an A. flavus spore suspension seven days after silk emergence. Ears were harvested approximately 60 days later and concentration of aflatoxin in the grain determined. Parental inbred lines Mp717, Mp313E, and Mp719 exhibited low levels (3-12 ng/g) of aflatoxin accumulation. In the diallel analysis, both general and specific combining ability were significant sources of variation in the inheritance of resistance to aflatoxin accumulation. General combining ability effects for reduced aflatoxin accumulation were greatest for Mp494, Mp719, and Mp717. These lines should be especially useful in breeding for resistance to aflatoxin accumulation. Breeding strategies, such as reciprocal recurrent selection, would be appropriate.	[Williams, W.

An alternative for this problem is to reduce and to optimize NIFE, with inoculants based in genus and species of plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). The aim of this research was to analyze G. max response to Azospirillum lipoiCrum and Rhizobium etli at 50% dose of NIFE. In that sense experimental was conducting by 5 treatments with NIFE at 100% and 50% doses for G. max inoculated with PGPB, response was based on its phenology: plant height (PH) and root length (RL) and its biomass: shoot fresh weight (SFW), root fresh weight (RFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), root dry weight (RDW). Experimental data were analyzed by ANOVA and Ttdcey HSD p < 0.05%. Results indicated a positive respond of G. max with A. lipoferum and R. etli at seedling level was registered 0.90 g of SDW, this numerical value was statistically different than 0.16 g of SDW of G. max not inoculating, fed with mineral solution with 100% of NIFE dose, used as relative control (RC). At level of flowering G. max responded to A. lipoferum and R. etli registered 3.17 g of RFW this numerical value was statistically different compared to 1.79 g of RFW of G. mar or RC. This data suggests that the positive respond of G. max was due to both PGPB able to transform radical exudates in phytohonnones to improve radical absorption of N and optimize NIFE reduced at 50% dose, showing health growing and at the same preventing soil's lost productivity.

A high-throughput glasshouse bioassay to detect crown rot resistance in wheat germplasm	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						aggressiveness; germplasm screening; Gibberella coronicola; inoculation method	HEAD BLIGHT RESISTANCE; FUSARIUM-GRAMINEARUM; WINTER-WHEAT; FOOT ROT; PATHOGENICITY; SCAB; ROOT	A high-throughput and reliable seedling bioassay to screen wheat germplasm for crown rot resistance was developed. Single wheat seedlings were grown in square seedling punnets in a glasshouse and inoculated with a monoconidial Fusarium pseudograminearum isolate 10 days after emergence. The punnets were laid horizontally on their side and a 10-mu L inoculum droplet placed on the stem base. Seedlings were incubated at near-saturated relative humidity, and crown rot severity was assessed 35 days after inoculation. Studies on the duration of incubation period, inoculum concentration and temperature were carried out to optimize these parameters. Seedling growth at 25/15(+/- 5)degrees C in a glasshouse and 48-h incubation at near-saturated RH in darkness gave the best results. When crown rot resistance rankings of 16 Australian cultivars from the bioassay were compared with their field performance, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was highly significant. This indicated that the seedling bioassay mimicked field resistance to crown rot in adult plants. A bootstrap resampling analysis showed little or no improvement in the coefficient of variation with an increasing number of replications, indicating a high level of precision and reproducibility. By detecting small but consistent differences in crown rot severity, the bioassay proved effective in large-scale screening for partial resistance: already over 1400 wheat genotypes have been screened. The high degree of precision makes this an invaluable tool in the understanding of pathogen aggressiveness, host specialization and parasitic fitness.

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of Si and Mn on the development of brown spot on rice plants grown in hydroponic culture. Rice plants (cv. 'Metica-1') were grown in plastic pots containing 0 or 2 mm Si (-Si and +Si treatments, respectively) with three Mn rates (0.5, 2.5 and 10 mu m). Plants were inoculated with B. oryzae 39 days after emergence. The following components of resistance were evaluated: incubation period (IP), number of lesions (NL) per cm(2) of leaf area, real disease severity (RDS) and area under brown spot progress curve (AUBSPC). The content of Si and Mn in the plant tissues was also determined. Si content was significantly higher in rice tissue of plants of the +Si treatment than of the -Si treatment regardless of the Mn rates used. The Mn rates did not affect the Si content of the rice plants. The Mn content of the rice tissues was significantly higher in the -Si treatment than on +Si treatment, regardless of the Mn rate used. The Mn content was significantly lower at 0.5 mu m Mn in comparison to the other rates for both -Si and +Si treatments. The IP of brown spot on rice leaves significantly increased in the +Si treatment; but the Mn rates in the presence of Si had no effect on IP. In the -Si treatment, the IP was significantly higher only at the rate of 2.5 mu m. The NL, RDS and AUBSPC were significantly reduced in the +Si treatment regardless of the Mn rates. The Mn rates in the presence of Si had no effect on these components of resistance. Overall, Si dramatically impacted the development of brown spot regardless of the presence of Mn at either low or high rates. This may be useful in regions where the soil has either toxic or deficient levels of Mn and cultivars with brown spot resistance are not commercially available.

Zinc fertilizer was applied to the shoots at 20 and 45 days after plant emergence (DAE), immediately before plant sampling. At 25 DAE, Zn fungicide increased soluble and total Zn in the fourth leaf. The same occurred, at 45 DAE, with the Zn fertilizer applied to the shoots. It were not observed significant increases on both soluble and total Zn contents in the fourth leaf of plants that received soil Zn fertilization. Even in the leaves with 262 mg Zn kg(-1), there was no phytotoxicity symptoms. The total Zn concentration at 20 DAE was the best index correlated to potato tuber yield reaching 50.9 mg Zn kg(-1) in the fourth leaf of plants at the highest marketable tuber yield treatment.

Four single fungicide application timings at the 5th trifoliolate (A), 1st flower (B), full flower (C) and 10 days after full flower (D) were compared to three sequential application timings (A + C, B + C and B + D). The experimental setup was a randomized complete block design with four replicates. Data on disease ratings for leaf veins and pods, plant maturity, dockage, pick, seed weight, yield and return on investment (ROI) were collected. For seed treatments, DCT provided superior disease control on leaf and pod tissue under low and high disease pressure. The combined effect of seed treatments and foliar spray timings improved plant health, extended crop maturity and increased yield over seed treatments alone. The sequential fungicide treatments were superior to the single fungicide treatments in most environments. Under moderate to severe disease pressure, two fungicide applications and a seed treatment are required to maximize economic returns for the grower. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Climate Change Experiment (CLIMEX) uses a site with an entire undisturbed boreal-forested catchment enclosed within an existing very large scale (1200m2 ground area) greenhouse. In the forthcoming year temperature will be increased stepwise to +3-degrees-C in summer, +5-degrees-C in winter and the atmospheric CO2 concentration enriched to 560 ppm which together simulate future changes in global climate and atmospheric composition predicted by GCMs. Plants growing within this low nutrient ecosystem are strongly dependent upon mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake and rates of nutrient uptake. Therefore it will provide an important test of current ideas concerning how mycorrhizas might modify plant responses to global change. We describe predictions of community phenology and gas exchange at the CLIMEX site; in the latter case the effects of including and excluding rates of on nutrient supply are considered. The results are discussed with reference to the opportunities presented by CLIMEX to reveal important aspects of the physiological responses of boreal ecosystems to global change.

Why do mixotrophic plants stay green? A comparison between green and achlorophyllous orchid individuals in situ	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS			English	Article						autotrophy; dormancy; fruit set; herbivory; mycorrhizae; Neottieae; orchids; parasitic load; partial mycoheterotrophy; plant phenology; seed germination	CEPHALANTHERA-LONGIFOLIA; CHLOROPHYLL-FREE; CARBON GAIN; MYCOHETEROTROPHIC ORCHIDS; ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; MYCORRHIZAL NETWORKS; ALBINO INDIVIDUALS; BLUE-LIGHT; ECTOMYCORRHIZAL; FUNGI	Some forest plants adapt to shade by mixotrophy, i.e., they obtain carbon both from photosynthesis and from their root mycorrhizal fungi. Fully achlorophyllous species using exclusively fungal carbon (the so-called mycoheterotrophic plants) have repeatedly evolved from such mixotrophic ancestors. However, adaptations for this evolutionary transition, and the reasons why it has happened a limited number of times, remain unknown. We investigated this using achlorophyllous variants (i.e., albinos) spontaneously occurring in Cephalanthera damasonium, a mixotrophic orchid. In two populations, we compared albinos with co-occurring green individuals in situ. We investigated vegetative traits, namely, shoot phenology, dormancy, CO2 and H2O leaf exchange, mycorrhizal colonization, degree of mycoheterotrophy (using C-13 abundance as a proxy), and susceptibility to pathogens and herbivores. We monitored seed production (in natural or experimental crosses) and seed germination. Albinos displayed (1) more frequent shoot drying at fruiting, possibly due to stomatal dysfunctions, (2) lower basal metabolism, (3) increased sensitivity to pathogens and herbivores, (4) higher dormancy and maladapted sprouting, and, probably due to the previous differences, (5) fewer seeds, with lower germination capacity. Over the growing season, green shoots shifted from using fungal carbon to an increasingly efficient photosynthesis at time of fruiting, when fungal colonization reached its minimum. Conversely, the lack of photosynthesis in fruiting albinos may contribute to carbon limitation, and to the above-mentioned trends. With a 10(3) x fitness reduction, albinos failed a successful transition to mycoheterotrophy because some traits inherited from their green ancestors are maladaptive. Conversely, mycoheterotrophy requires at least degeneration of leaves and stomata, optimization of the temporal pattern of fungal colonization and shoot sprouting, and new defenses against pathogens and herbivores. Transition to mycoheterotrophy likely requires progressive, joint evolution of these traits, while a sudden loss of photosynthesis leads to unfit plants. We provide explanations for the evolutionary stability of mixotrophic nutrition and for the rarity of emergence of carbon sinks in mycorrhizal networks. More broadly, this may explain what prevents the emergence of fully heterotrophic taxa in the numerous other mixotrophic plant or algal lineages recently described.

CARBOHYDRATE-METABOLISM; GENE-EXPRESSION; RESISTANCE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; LEAVES; BLAST; FLUORESCENCE; ARABIDOPSIS; PHOSPHATE	Blast, caused by Pyricularia oryzae, has become a devastating disease on wheat in several countries worldwide. Growers need alternative methods for blast management, and silicon (Si) stands out for its potential to decrease the intensity of important diseases in several crops. This study investigated the effect of Si on improving photoassimilate production on flag leaves of wheat plants and their partitioning to spikes in a scenario where blast symptoms decreased as a result of potentiation of defense mechanisms by Si. Wheat plants (cultivar BRS Guamirim) were grown in hydroponic culture with 0 or 2 mM Si and inoculated with P. oryzae at 10 days after anthesis. The Si concentration on flag leaves and spikes of Si-supplied plants increased and resulted in lower blast symptoms. High concentrations of total soluble phenols and lignin-thioglycolic acid derivatives and greater peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, b-1,3-glucanase, and chitinase activity occurred on flag leaves and spikes of Si-supplied plants and increased their resistance to blast. The concentration of photosynthetic pigments decreased and the photosynthetic performance of infected flag leaves and spikes from plants not supplied with Si was impaired for chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters including maximal photosystem II quantum efficiency, fraction of energy absorbed used in photochemistry, quantum yield of nonregulated energy dissipation, and quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation. The concentration of soluble sugars was lower on infected flag leaves and spikes from plants not supplied with Si, whereas the hexose-to-sucrose ratio increased on infected flag leaves. Sucrosephosphate synthase activity was lower and acid invertase activity was higher on flag leaves and spikes of plants not supplied with Si, respectively, compared with Si-supplied plants. The starch concentration on spikes of Si-supplied plants increased. In conclusion, Si showed a beneficial effect in improving the source-sink relationship of infected flag leaves and spikes by preserving alterations in assimilate production and partitioning during the grain filling process.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation of roots of grass species differing in invasiveness	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Calamagrostis epigejos; Cynodon dactylon; Grasses; Invasive plants; Semiarid temperate grassland	PLANT INVASIONS; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; COMPETITIVE ABILITY; SOIL BIOTA; FUNGI; GROWTH; EVOLUTION; FEEDBACK; ALTER; SUPPRESSES	Recent research indicates that the soil microbial community, particularly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), can influence plant invasion in several ways. We tested if 1) invasive species are colonised by AMF to a lower degree than resident native species, and 2) AMF colonisation of native plants is lower in a community inhabited by an invasive species than in an uninvaded resident community. The two tests were run in semiarid temperate grasslands on grass (Poaceae) species, and the frequency and intensity of mycorrhizal colonisation, and the proportion of arbuscules and vesicles in plant roots have been measured. In the first test, grasses representing three classes of invasiveness were included: invasive species, resident species becoming abundant upon disturbance, and non-invasive native species. Each class contained one C3 and one C4 species. The AMF colonisation of the invasive Calamagrostis epigejos and Cynodon dactylon was consistently lower than that of the non-invasive native Chrysopogon gryllus and Bromus inermis, and contained fewer arbuscules than the post-disturbance dominant resident grasses Bothriochloa ischaemum and Brachypodium pinnatum. The C3 and C4 grasses behaved alike despite their displaced phenologies in these habitats. The second test compared AMF colonisation for sand grassland dominant grasses Festuca vaginata and Stipa borysthenica in stands invaded by either C. epigejos or C. dactylon, and in the uninvaded natural community. Resident grasses showed lower degree of AMF colonisation in the invaded stand compared to the uninvaded natural community with F. vaginata responding so to both invaders, while S. borysthenica responding to C. dactylon only. These results indicate that invasive grasses supposedly less reliant on AMF symbionts have the capacity of altering the soil mycorrhizal community in such a way that resident native species can establish a considerably reduced extent of the beneficial AMF associations, hence their growth, reproduction and ultimately abundance may decline. Accumulating evidence suggests that such indirect influences of invasive alien plants on resident native species mediated by AMF or other members of the soil biota is probably more the rule than the exception.

Three experiments are conducted to assess the fungitoxicity of methylene chloride/methanol leaf extracts of seven plants on P. infestans development. The extracts (3%) are evaluated for sporangial germination inhibition, latent and incubation periods, lesion size and late blight severity on tomato plants. Inoculated leaflets and plants are incubated in the greenhouse at 21 degrees C during the day and 18 degrees C during the night, with a 12 h photoperiod and for 7 days. Sporangial germination is significantly inhibited by Tephrosia vogelli and Entandrophragma angolense extracts, while disease progression is highly limited by Ageratum houstonianum, Tephrosia vogelli, Clausena anisata and Entandrophragma angolense extracts. The fungitoxic effects of some of the extracts is comparable to synthetic fungicides, metalaxyl and maneb, used as positive controls, indicating their potential as components of an integrated pathogen management programme for tomato late blight. Eucalyptus saligna, Deinbollia saligna and Garcinia smeathmannii extracts have low efficiency.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of earthworms (Amynthas spp.) on growth in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and on soil biological attributes. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using a completely randomized design with five treatments and eight repetitions. The treatments consisted of inoculation with five different quantities of earthworms of the genus Amynthas (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 worms per pot). Each experimental unit consisted of a plastic pot containing 4 kg of soil and two common bean plants. The experiment was harvested 38 days after seedling emergence. Dry matter and plant height, soil respiration, microbial respiration, microbial biomass, and metabolic quotient were determined. Earthworm recovery in our study was high in number and mass, with all values above 91.6% and 89.1%, respectively. In addition, earthworm fresh biomass decreased only in the treatment that included eight earthworms per pot. The presence of earthworms increased the plant growth and improved soil biological properties, suggesting that agricultural practices that favor the presence of these organisms can be used to increase the production of common bean, and the increased soil CO2 emission caused by the earthworms can be partially offset by the addition of common bean crop residues to the soil.

The Most Probable Number (MPN) of rhizobia cells capable of nodulating green grams were between 519 and 3,780 per gram of soil in SE-Kenya. These results were confirmed by lack of response to inoculation and effective nodulation of the control plants under field conditions. Green grams intercropped with maize had significantly higher dry weights than the ones grown as pure stand, 21 days after emergence (DAE). The increase was transitory because it was not observed at podding (42 DAE) and at physiological maturity (100 DAE). Green gram yield was mot affected by maize intercrop. However, maize yields were significantly reduced by intercropping with green grams. Soil analysis from treatment plots before and after the cropping season indicated that green grams increased soil nitrogen slightly or maintained it at preplanting levels. This was unlike pure maize plots where there was a decline in soil nitrogen (N).

The CCT (CO, COL and TOC1) gene family was elucidated to participate in the molecular regulation of flowering in plants. We identified 36 CCT genes in the M. truncatula genome and they were classified into three distinct subfamilies, PRR (7), COL (11) and CMF (18). Synteny and phylogenetic analyses revealed that CCT genes occurred before the differentiation of monocot and dicot, and CCT orthologous genes might have diversified among plants. The diverse spatial-temporal expression profiles indicated that MtCCT genes could be key regulators in flowering time, as well as in the development of seeds and nodules in M. truncatula. Notably, 22 MtCCT genes with typical circadian rhythmic variations suggested their different responses to light. The response to various hormones of MtCCT genes demonstrated that they participate in plant growth and development via varied hormones dependent pathways. Moreover, six MtCCT genes were dramatically induced by salinity and dehydration treatments, illustrating their vital roles in the prevention of abiotic injury. Collectively, our study provides valuable information for the in-depth investigation of the molecular mechanism of flowering time in M. truncatula, and it also provides candidate genes for alfalfa molecular breeding with ideal flowering time.

Parents, F-1, F-2, and backcross generations were evaluated in two locations in eastern Canada in 1993 and 1994. Plants were inoculated with a macroconidial suspension using a kernel-stab method 15 days after silk emergence. Disease severity was assessed at harvest using a seven-class rating scale. Significant differences were observed among the generation means in all environments. In general, the F-1 did not differ significantly from the resistant parent except at one location in 1993. The frequency distribution of the F-2 and backcross generations showed continuous variation. Generation means analysis indicated that resistance to F. graminearum was under genetic control with both simple (additive and dominance) and digenic (dominance x dominance) effects contributing to the total genetic variation among the generation means. Weighted least square regression indicated that more than 68% of the genetic variation could be explained by additive effects. Estimates of the number of effective factors affecting kernel resistance ranged from 4.6 to 13.7.

Moench] cultivars with partial resistance to Striga spp. and Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. strigae (FOS) represents a novel strategy to control Striga. This study aimed to identify the nature of gene action controlling grain yield and yield components and to select promising sorghum crosses possessing both FOS compatibility and Striga resistance, along with good combining ability effects. One-hundred hybrids, developed from pairwise matings among 10 FOS compatible, high-yielding female lines and 10 Striga-resistant male lines, were evaluated with and without FOS inoculation. The F(1)s were field evaluated at three locations in Tanzania known for their severe Striga infestation, using an alpha lattice design with two replications. General (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) variances were significant for grain yield per plant, hundred-seed weight, plant height, flowering time and the number of Striga plants.

This study was performed to investigate the response to R. solani AG-5 infection in potato. Minitubers (cv. Favorita) were inoculated by the R. solani AG-5 strain. Four days after emergence of R. solani AG-5 infection on the young stem of potato, samples were collected and prepared for the Illumina sequencing. The Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and control plants were performed. Functional analysis of these DEGs indicated a total of 338 DEGs, including 216 up-regulated (63.91%) and 122 downregulated DEGs (36.09%), were identified between the control and R. solani infected potato plants. These DEGs were associated with the plant growth, defense, fungal resistance by modulating the oxidative response (including NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance proteins, ankyrin repeat-containing proteins, ANKs; and peroxidases), ion exchange/transportation (including calcineurin B-like proteins, CBLs; CBL-interacting protein kinase, CIPKs; calmodulin-like proteins, CMLs; and K+ channel, KAT1) and plant hormone-mediated signaling (MYB44, ANKs). Some essential transcription factors including WRKY45 and MYB4 were significantly upregulated by R. solani infection. The R. solani infection triggered DEGs were related to plant growth, defense, oxidative response, and hormone-mediated signaling. The genes of CBL4, KAT1, ANKs, and MYBs might promote potato adjustment or resistance against R. solani infection.

Here, experiments conducted to determine the mechanism of the recovery phenotype and whether enhanced resistance could be obtained by combining transgenes from susceptible and recovery plants are reported. Upper leaves of SqMV-3 plants were sampled for Northern analysis at 17, 31 and 45 days after germination (DAG) and a proportion of plants were inoculated with SqMV. SqMV-3 plants inoculated at a young stage (17 DAG) showed susceptible or recovery phenotypes, However, a number of plants inoculated at later developmental stages (31 or 45 DAG) were resistant to infection. Resistance of recovery plants was due to PTGS that was activated at a later developmental stage, independent of virus infection. Similar results were observed with plants grown under field conditions. To investigate the interactions of transgenes, progeny of crosses between SqMV-127, -3 and -22 were inoculated with SqMV, Progeny with the transgene of line 127 were resistant. However, a number of plants with transgenes from the recovery and susceptible lines or the self-pollinated recovery line were resistant even when inoculated at a young stage. Northern analysis suggested that resistance was due to PTGS, The results reveal that the timing of PTGS and consequent resistance of the transgenic plants were affected by their developmental stage and the interaction of transgene inserts.

However, the two techniques have always been tested in isolation, when their positive effects are less compared to when they are able to act together. In the present work, two rootstocks combined with the mycorrhizal fungus Rizophagus intraradices were compared, with the aim of evaluating their behaviour on the growth of tomato plants in soils infested with N. aberrans, the false root-knot nematode. The experiment was set up in a completely randomised design with ten replications, in a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial scheme. The treatments consisted of a combination of three factors: a) plant composition: two rootstocks (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiform 'Carolina' and S. lycopersicum 'Maxifort'), onto which the 'Santa Clara' tomato (S. lycopersicum) was grafted, and a non-grafted plant, considered the control, which was the same cultivar as the graft; b) mycorrhization: mycorrhizal or non-mycorrhizal roots; c) a substrate infested or not infested with N. aberrans. The plants grafted onto 'Maxifort' showed significantly greater growth for shoot dry weight, root fresh weight and stem diameter. The rootstock under test had a lower pathogen reproductive factor than did the ungrafted plant. Mycorrhization contributed to a reduction in the number of days until flowering, and a reduction in the final population of N. aberrans for the three plant compositions under test.

Plants were hand pollinated, and individual kernels were inoculated with a needle dipped in a suspension of A. flavus conidia 21 days after pollination. Kernels were harvested at 1- to 2-day intervals from 1 to 21 days after inoculation (DAI). Kernels were placed in FAA fixative, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with toluidine blue. Kernels were also collected additional kernels for aflatoxin analyses in 2013 and 2014. At 2 DAI, A. flavus hyphae were observed among endosperm cells in the susceptible hybrid, but colonization of the endosperm in the resistant hybrid was limited to the wound site of the resistant hybrid. Sections of the scutellum of the susceptible hybrid were colonized by A. flavus by 5 DAI. Fungal growth was slower in the resistant hybrid compared to the susceptible hybrid. By 10 DAI, A. flavus had colonized a large section of the embryo in the susceptible hybrid; whereas in the resistant hybrid, approximately half of the endosperm had been colonized and very few cells in the embryo were colonized. Fungal colonization in some of the kernels of the resistant hybrid was slowed in the aleurone layer or at the endosperm-scutellum interface. In wounded kernels with intact aleurone layers, the fungus spread around the kernel between the pericarp and aleurone layer with minimal colonization of the endosperm. Aflatoxin B-1 was first detected in susceptible kernel tissues 8 DAI in 2013 (14 mu g/kg) and 2014 (18 mu g/kg). The resistant hybrid had significantly lower levels of aflatoxin accumulation compared to the susceptible hybrid at harvests 10, 21, and 28 DAI in 2013, and 20 and 24 DAI in 2014. Our study found differential A. flavus colonization of susceptible and resistant kernel tissues, and that the aleurone and the outer layer of the scutellum slowed the rate of colonization by A. flavus.

Rhizobacterial community structure differences among sorghum cultivars in different growth stages and soils	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Sorghum genotypes; rhizosphere; bacterial community composition; 16S rRNA; next-generation sequencing; strigolactone	BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES; RHIZOSPHERE MICROBIOME; PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; PLANT GENOTYPE; STRIGOLACTONES; CROP; PRODUCTIVITY; SELECTION; PACKAGE; SHAPE	Plant genotype selects the rhizosphere microbiome. The success of plant-microbe interactions is dependent on factors that directly or indirectly influence the plant rhizosphere microbial composition. We investigated the rhizosphere bacterial community composition of seven different sorghum cultivars in two different soil types (abandoned (CF) and agricultural (VD)). The rhizosphere bacterial community was evaluated at four different plant growth stages: emergence of the second (day 10) and third leaves (day 20), the transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages (day 35), and the emergence of the last visible leaf (day 50). At early stages (days 10 and 20), the sorghum rhizosphere bacterial community composition was mainly driven by soil type, whereas at late stages (days 35 and 50), the bacterial community composition was also affected by the sorghum genotype. Although this effect of sorghum genotype was small, different sorghum cultivars assembled significantly different bacterial community compositions. In CF soil, the striga-resistant cultivar had significantly higher relative abundances of Acidobacteria GP1, Burkholderia, Cupriavidus (Burkholderiaceae), Acidovorax and Albidiferax (Comamonadaceae) than the other six cultivars. This study is the first to simultaneously investigate the contributions of plant genotype, plant growth stage and soil type in shaping sorghum rhizosphere bacterial community composition.

The phyto-impact of fluazinam fungicide on cellular structure, agro-physiological, and yield traits of pepper and eggplant crops	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Antioxidants; Cell ultrastructure; Eggplant; Fungicide fluazinam; Metabolites; Pepper	CARBOHYDRATE PHYSIOLOGY; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CAPSICUM-ANNUUM; ASCORBIC-ACID; ACCUMULATION; GLUTATHIONE; METABOLISM; REDUCTASE; DROUGHT	Fluazinam is a widely used fungicide; most of the available information associated with its impact predominately on birds, invertebrates, mammals, and algae and scarce works studied its impact on crop plants. A two years-field experiments were conducted to study the response of pepper and eggplant to fluazinam at 0, 1, 2, and 3 times of the fluazinam-recommended dose (0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mL/L). The results revealed that fluazinam did not cause toxic effect on the tested plants except for temporary decline of shoot weights and lengths after 3 days of fluazinam application. However, fluazinam improved the physiological status of leaves via promoting metabolites, antioxidants, better membrane integrity, and adjustment of the redox status of fluazinam-sprayed plants. The ultrastructure changes of fluazinam-treated leaves associated with increment of chloroplasts' starch granules, giant nucleus, and elevated number of mitochondria. After 35 days of treatments, plant length of fungicide-treated plants was found to be higher than control and flowering time showed significant earliness. Furthermore, the yield traits were increased significantly in response to fluazinam. Our findings suggested that fluazinam-treated plants could initiate an early defense mechanism to mitigate the permanent growth retardation. This study could serve as a matrix for further studies to seek elucidation of plants' response to other doses of fluazinam. .

Among the different groups of defence proteins, plant food allergens were identified. We hypothesized that tomato-allergic patients differently react to tomatoes derived from plants inoculated or not by mycorrhizal fungi. To test this, two tomato genotypes, wild-type 76R and a nearly isogenic mycorrhizal mutant RMC, were inoculated with the AM fungus Glomus mosseae or not under conditions similar to horticultural practice. Under such conditions, the AM fungus showed only a very low colonisation rate, but still was able to increase shoot growth of the wild-type 76R. Nearly no colonisation was observed in the mutant RMC, and shoot development was also not affected. Root fresh weights were diminished in AM-inoculated plants of both genotypes compared to the corresponding controls. No mycorrhizal effects were observed on the biomass and the concentration of phosphate and nitrogen in fruits. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that six among eight genes encoding for putative allergens showed a significant induced RNA accumulation in fruits of AM-colonised plants. However, human skin reactivity tests using mixed samples of tomato fruits from the AM-inoculated and control plants showed no differences. Our data indicate that AM colonisation under conditions close to horticultural practice can induce the expression of allergen-encoding genes in fruits, but this does not lead necessarily to a higher allergenic potential.

The study was conducted in pot experiments using a mixture of soil: sand (1:1 v: v) under greenhouse conditions. Bacillus subtilis EY2, Bacillus atrophaeus EY6, and Bacillus spharicus GC subgrup B EY30 were isolated in highly salty soils in Upper Coruh Valley in Turkey. Seeds were soaked in the bacterial suspension incubated at 27C for 2 h. Emergence percentage (EP) was reduced and mean emergence time (MET) raised with sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions. Inoculated seeds displayed greater EP and less MET compared to the non-inoculated ones. Salinity negatively affected growth of radish; however, plant growth promoting bacteria treatments positively affected growth parameters such as fresh weight (278% for shoot, 371% for root) and dry weights (250% for shoot, 422% for root) compared to non-treated plants that were challenged with salt stress. Furthermore, selected bacteria caused an increase in uptake of minerals except sodium (Na) compared to the non-treated controls in both salt stress and salt stress absence. Sodium concentration of plant leaves was increased by salt stress while bacterial inoculation decreased its concentration. Bacterial treatments increased chlorophyll content and decreased electrolyte leakage of plants in saline conditions. Leaf relative water content (LRWC) of plants in the salt stress condition increased with bacterial application, but reduced without bacterial application. The present study suggests that PGPB seed treatments can ameliorate the deleterious effects of salt stress on radish plants and PGPB could offer an economical and simple application to reduce problems of radish production in an Aridisol caused by high salinity.

The evolution of resistance and tolerance also may be constrained by negative genetic correlations between these defense systems. Using a complete diallel, we measured genetic variation and covariation for and among performance, resistance, and tolerance traits in Mimulus guttatus challenged with a generalist pathogen, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Viral coat protein was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in all inoculated plants, indicating that all plants were susceptible to infection, although the ELISA absorbance varied quantitatively across plants. Plants inoculated with CMV had significantly reduced aboveground biomass and flower production relative to controls, although date of first flower was unaffected by infection. All three of these performance traits showed moderate to high narrow-sense heritability (h(2) 0.32-0.62) in both inoculated and control plants. We found phenotypic variation for both tolerance of and resistance to our strain of CMV, but both displayed very low narrow-sense heritability (h(2)<0.03). We found no evidence of a trade-off between resistance and tolerance. We also found no evidence for a cost of resistance or tolerance. In fact, a significant genetic correlation suggested that plants that were large when healthy had the greatest tolerance when infected. Significant, positive genetic correlations found between performance of uninfected and infected plants suggested that selection would likely favor the same M. guttatus genotypes whether CMV is present or not.

A leaf regeneration assay	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES			English	Article						desiccation tolerance; bryophyte; desert; leaf regeneration; sex dimorphism; sex ratio; protonema	TORTULA-RURALIS; PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; PHYSIOLOGICAL-ASPECTS; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; MOJAVE DESERT; GROWTH-RATES; RATIOS; REHYDRATION; RESPONSES	Disparate sex ratios are a widespread pattern in dioecious bryophytes, with female-biased ratios especially prevalent in arid environments. The absence of male plants in environments experiencing high desiccation pressure prompted the hypothesis that male plants may be less desiccation tolerant than female plants in the desert moss Syntrichia caninervis. This hypothesis was investigated by exposing detached leaves to consecutive wet/rapid-dry treatments and monitoring viability, protonemal emergence time, shoot production, growth rate of secondary protonemata, and microbial infection frequency over a 56-d period. The desiccation treatment consisted of exposure of mature 1-yr-old leaves to zero, two, four, and six wet/rapid-dry cycles. Hydrated leaves were then allowed to regenerate. Desiccation stress level was significantly correlated to reduced protonemal emergence, reduced growth rates, and reduced shoot production. Female detached leaves produced protonemata more quickly, and these protonemata grew twice as rapidly and eventually produced more shoots than male detached leaves. Male leaves were also more subject to mortality and microbial infection, although these trends were not statistically significant. No sex 3 desiccation stress interactions occurred in the stress responses measured. The disparity in growth rates between female and male leaf regeneration, under both stressed and nonstressed conditions, may play a significant role in male rarity. We conclude (i) that the leaf regeneration assay works well as a response variable for desiccation tolerance (DT) studies and (ii) that sex-based DT, at least with respect to responses to rapid drying cycles in the lab, while not indicated in Syntrichia, may yet operate under field conditions.

The degradation of individual PAHs was in range of 20-60% at the end of 54 days of composting followed by further increase of PAH removal (37-80%) after another 100 days of maturation. Both chemical analysis of the contaminated soil for PAHs and ecotoxicity tests on bioluminescent bacteria, earthworms, and plant seeds were performed before and after the composting. After the composting, inhibition of bioluminescence decreased, whereas no significant change in toxicity was observed for earthworm survival and seed germination. Using bacterial culture of Escherichia coli K12 genotoxicity tests were performed on samples taken from different parts of the composting pile; after the composting the decrease in genotoxicity was observed only in the sample taken from upper part of the composted pile.

The experiment was conducted in 2007/2008 season in cerrado in Gurupi, TO. Five treatments were studied with strains BR3301, BR3302, BR3267, BR3299 and BR3262 and treatment as a control (no inoculation and fertilizer). Plants were collected at 15, 25, 35, 45, 55 and 65 days after emergence (DAE) to determine the distribution of dry mass of leaves, stems, flowers and pods and the weight ratio of plant parts. Grain yield was determined at harvest as grain moisture reached 13%. We established the Pearson correlation coefficient of variables. The witness and BR3299 treatments promoted greater dry mass of plants at 65 DAE. The highest yield was obtained by the witness and BR3267. Further study is needed on the selection of strains of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in cowpea under various soil and climate in the state of Tocantins.

On the first stage, the bioavailable P content in 14 samples from some Brazilian soil classes with different vegetation, was determined. For this goal, an incubation essay (bioassay) was carried out in an environment with controlled temperature in a completely randomized block design with two replications. The same soil samples used in the bioassay were used in an experiment carried out in a greenhouse, using the same experimental design with three replications. The soils were cultivated with signal grass (Brachiaria decumbens, Stapf) during 42 days after seed germination. It was observed that the Po labile and the microbial P, together, presented a higher content when compared to the Pi labile in the majority of soil samples. It was also observed that the P accumulation in the aerial portion of Brachiaria decumbens was positively related to the bioavailable reservoir of this element. The soils that showed the highest organic phosphors acid soluble (Po H+) and total organic phosphorus (Pot) contents showed a higher P accumulation by the B. decumbens.

To date, little is known about the environmental behavior and fate of its residues in soil. To explore its potential environmental risks to crop production and food safety, three typical Chinese agricultural soils were examined by analyzing adsorption, mobility leaching, and degraded metabolites of exianliumi in soils. Exianliumi inclined to bind more to Heilongjiang soil (HLJS), followed by Nanjing soil (NJS) and Jiangxi soil (JXS). Soil thin-layer chromatography and column leaching tests showed a weak migration in HLJS and strong mobility in JXS. Under the same condition, exianliumi rapidly decayed in NJS, followed by HLJS and JXS. The differential degradative capacity for exianliumi in the soils was related to chemical, physical and biological interactions basically through organic matter content, temperature, soil moisture and microorganisms. The half-normal, normal and pareto effect plots demonstrated that temperature, microorganisms and soil moisture dominantly influenced the degradation of exianliumi. We further characterized metabolites of exianliumi catabolized in NJS using High Resolution Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometer/Mass Spectrometer (HRLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). Eight degradation products and three conjugates of exianliumi were detected and the possible degradative pathways were highlighted. This is the first report about exianliumi degradation in soils with multi-pathways, which provides the basic data for environmental risk assessment of crop production and food security.

Linkages of plant phenological characteristics with belowground root-associated fungal communities have rarely been investigated, and thus our aim was to search for an interplay between contrasting phenology of host ectomycorrhizal trees from the same location and root-associated fungal communities (ectomycorrhizal, endophytic, saprotrophic and pathogenic root-associated fungi) in young and in adult silver fir trees. The study was performed in a managed silver fir forest site. Twenty-four soil samples collected under two phenologically contrasting silver fir groups were analyzed for differences in root-associated fungal communities using Illumina sequencing of a total root-associated fungal community. Significant differences in beta diversity and in mean alpha diversity were confirmed for overall community of ectomycorrhizal root-associated fungi, whereas for ecologically different non-ectomycorrhizal root-associated fungal communities the differences were significant only for beta diversity and not for mean alpha diversity. At genus level root-associated fungal communities differed significantly between early and late flushing young and adult silver fir trees. We discuss the interactions through which the phenology of host plants either drives or is driven by the root-associated fungal communities in conditions of a sustainably co-naturally managed silver fir forest.

Green and red-variegated coleus plants were supplied with varying applied nitrogen concentrations (0, 25, 50 100 200, and 400 ppm) for 32 d before being artificially inoculated with citrus mealybugs. Femalle citrus meallybug life history parameters including eggs contained within the egg mass and respective body cavity, body length (mm), and developmental time (d) were measured. A modified micro-Kjedahl digestion procedure followed by colormetric assay was conducted twice throughout the study to assess leaf nitrogen concentration. The results of this study show that the citrus mealybug life history parameters were influenced by the applied nitrogen concentrations (ppm), leaf nitrogen concentration (%), and total moisture content (g). Citrus mealybugs feeding on both green and red-variegated coleus, receiving the high nitrogen fertilizer concentrations (200 and 400 ppm) had the greatest egg loads, were larger in size, and had the shortest developmental times. Leaf nitrogen concentration also affected the citrus mealybug life history parameters with those mealybugs feeding on plants containing the highest leaf nitrogen contents having the greatest egg loads, larger in size, and the shortest developmental times. In addition, total plant moisture content impacted the citrus mealybug life history parameters similar to leaf nitrogen concentration. However, this was based oil plant architecture whereas percent plant moisture content for both green- and red-variegated coleus was comparatively similar for all nitrogen concentrations. The life history parameters measured were more pronounced on green coleus compared with red-variegated coleus, perhaps because of nitrogen allocation differences between the two coleus colors. Thus, higher nitrogen concentrations, in the form of supplemental fertilizers used in greenhouse production systems, leads to an increase in the performance of citrus mealybugs as defined by increased egg loads, larger mature females,and shorter developmental times on coleus plants. These results indicate that the implementation of proper fertilizer practices may lessen the likelihood of dealing with extensive insect outbreaks, thus potentially reducing insecticide use.

Immediate conservation actions, including ex situ conservation, pollination observations, and studies of asymbiotic germination, reintroduction and relocation to new habitats have been conducted because the single existing population is threatened by habitat degradation. In this study, next generation sequencing by Illumina MiSeq with primer pair ITS-3 (F) and ITS-4OF (R) amplified ITS 2 region was conducted to identify and explore the associated uncultivatable fungal community structure and dynamics through seasonal and environmental changes. Assessments of the entire fungal communities from different seasons and habitats indicated that the communities were sensitive to changes in habitat but not to seasonal changes. Between plant roots and soil, two independent fungal communities and compartmentalization of microhabitats were detected. Hydrolysable nitrogen, total phosphorous, and water content were the most significant factors for fungal communities. Fungal community change could be related to nutrient requirements and plant phenology. Paphiopedilum spicerianum can associate with a wide range of orchid mycorrhizal fungal genera and is capable of utilizing different genera simultaneously. The low specificity to mycorrhizal fungi in adult Paphiopedilum spicerianum suggests that the choice of locations for new populations might be broader than initially anticipated.

Hordeum vulgare Signal Recognition Particle 72 (HvSRP72) was previously identified as differentially induced at 6h and/or 12h after infection in powdery mildew disease resistance, suggesting its involvement in pathogen response. Since there is limited information on R gene-mediated signaling cascade, we sought to understand the way which HvSRP72 protein functions in powdery mildew resistance or susceptibility response. HvSRP72 was silenced by barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-induced gene silencing, in order to understand its role in the plant response to pathogen infection. The level of HvSRP72 mRNA in silenced plant samples showed an average 57% reduction with respect to control plants (BSMV:00). The change in resistance or susceptibility to powdery mildew in HvSRP72-silenced plant leaves was determined by measuring the length of hyphal extensions and the germination efficiency upon inoculation. Under susceptible conditions, in HvSRP72-silenced samples spores germinated approximately four times more efficiently and Bgh development was also increased twice with respect to control plants. On the other hand, under the resistant condition, no difference was observed in HvSRP72-silenced samples when compared to the non-silenced ones. Thus, it can be concluded that silencing of HvSRP72 enhances Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei susceptibility but no change of hyphal growth was observed during resistance response.

Samples were processed according to usual methods for anatomy, histochemistry and ultrastructure. Colleters are conical and constituted by a central axis of elongated parenchyma cells from which radiate numerous epidermal cells. Epidermal cells are cylindrical on the vegetative apex and digitiform or bulbous on reproductive apex. Both colleters produce hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds. On the vegetative apex, epidermal cells present numerous well-developed Golgi bodies associated with a network of smooth endoplasmatic reticulum (SER), scarce oil bodies and profiles of rough endoplasmatic reticulum (RER), indicating the involvement of these glands in the production of mainly polysaccharides in addition to protein and lipids. Differently, epidermal cells on bracts and sepals present abundant and prominent oil drops, fewer Golgi bodies and a well developed network of SER with locally dilated cisterns indicating predominance of lipids. Ecrine and granulocrine mechanisms are common to colleters of both apices. We hypothesize that exudates protect vegetative meristems and developing organs against desiccation in the dry season and against insects and pathogens during the wet season. Predominantly lipidic secretion protects the floral organs against dehydration in the dry season and can attract floral visitants. These aspects are relevant if one considers that A. sessilis inhabits the cerrado, an environment characterized by a well-delimited dry season, high irradiance and elevated vapor pressure deficits.

Perola seedlings were evaluated. The germination study was performed in a completely randomized design (CRD), factorial of 3 (G. albida, G. etunicatum, S. heterogama) x 4 (C210, RAB9, ENF10 and control) with five replicates, in plate with water-agar, where the bacteria and spores were inoculated and evaluated after 21 and 28 days. The co-inoculation study was performed in a CRD, factorial of 5 (G. albida, G. etunicatum, S. heterogama, mixture of AMF and control) x 5 (C210, RAB9, ENF10, mixture of PGPB and control) and six replicates. At the 21(th) day RAB9 stimulated germination of G. albida in relation to the others PGPB; ENF10 stimulated the germination of G. etunicatum in relation to absence of bacteria, where the spores did not germinate; differences were not observed for S. heterogama. At the 28(th) day C210 inhibited the germination of G. albida. In both periods, G. albida showed higher germination rate. In absence of PGPB, G. albida improved growth more than G. etunicatum. The effect of G. albida on seedlings can be inhibited by C210 and by the bacterial mixture. It was confirmed that AMF germination can be stimulated or inhibited in presence of PGPB while the mycorrhizal symbiosis can be inhibited. In general co-inoculation of AMF and PGPB did not improve growth of pineapple cv. Perola during the aclimatization period until the 90(th) day.

J	631		GOODWIN, J				GOODWIN, J			THE ROLE OF MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG NATIVE BUNCHGRASSES AND ALIEN WEEDS - A REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS	NORTHWEST SCIENCE			English	Article								The role of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi in competitive interactions among native bunchgrasses and alien weeds is reviewed. Brief reviews of the mycorrhizal symbiosis and rangeland ecology provide a background for discussion of the role of VAM fungi in inter- and intraspecific competition in sagebrush-grass systems. Plants can be significantly better competitors for soil resources when mycorrhizal than when not mycorrhizal, and VAM fungi can alter the outcome of competitive interactions among plants. Additionally, soil resources can be transferred from one plant to another through a network of hyphae produced by VAM fungi; such transport can improve growth in the receiver plant. The response of a plant to the formation of mycorrhizae depends upon the taxa of the plant and fungal symbionts, their phenologies, and on the severity of environmental stress. Native bunchgrasses of the Intermountain West are mychorrhizal. Alien weeds introduced to the sagebrush steppe include both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal species. When a rangeland site is colonized by nonmycorrhizal species, VAM fungi populations decline. In the absence of VAM fungi, mycorrhizal bunchgrasses are at a competitive disadvantage compared to nonmycorrhizal species in capturing limited soil resources. However, the opposite is also true: mycorrhizal species out-compete nonmycorrhizal species when VAM fungi are abundant. One naturalized alien, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), is a facultative host of mycorrhizal fungi. Cheatgrass is an effective competitor in the rangeland environment, and its relative competitive ability, compared to native bunchgrasses, is unlikely to be altered by VAM fungi. Though mycorrbizal fungi would enhance the competitive ability of native bunchgrasses, cheatgrass would reap comparable or greater benefit since it also hosts VAM fungi and, due to a rapid rate of growth, acts as a strong sink for soil resources. This is probably one of the factors behind continued, long-term occupancy and/or dominance of rangeland sites by cheatgrass. However, it is not unreasonable to expect greater efficiency among coevolved mutualists compared to a profiteering alien. If assimilates are more efficiently transferred from a native bunchgrass to its progeny, then VAM fungi have an important role to play in the restoration of Intermountain rangelands. Research into the role of mycorrhizal fungi in competitive interspecific interactions, rhizosphere community dynamics, the mycorrhizal dependence of rangeland grasses, and patterns of translocation is needed before definitive answers can be presented.

Photosynthetic O-2 evolution, chlorophyll content, 3-phosphoglycerate content, and the gel electrophoretic pattern of thylakoid membrane proteins were investigated in rust-infected and healthy plants of the fully susceptible isoline Prelude, the moderately resistant isoline Prelude-Sr24, and the highly resistant isoline Prelude-Sr5. The rate of net photosynthesis, expressed per unit leaf area, was not significantly changed in any of the three near-isogenic lines during the early stages of infection, then increased slightly in the highly resistant line, while decreasing in the moderately resistant and fully susceptible lines. In the moderately resistant plants, this decrease continued linearly until 8 days after inoculation when no photosynthetic activity was detectable. In the susceptible line, the decrease gradually slowed down around 4-6 days after inoculation and photosynthetic activity remained constant thereafter. The chlorophyll content decreased only slightly during infection in highly resistant plants, but chlorophyll eventually disappeared completely from the infected, moderately resistant plants. The initially similarly strong decrease in chlorophyll content in the susceptible plants gradually came to a halt during the later stages of infection. Expressed per unit chlorophyll, photosynthetic O-2 evolution increased slightly in highly resistant plants, remained unchanged in moderately resistant plants, and decreased to a stable level in the susceptible plants. The infection-induced changes in the 3-phosphoglycerate content closely resembled the changes in O-2 evolution. No infection-induced changes were observed in the thylakoid membrane proteins from leaves of all three isolines. The results are discussed in relation to previously described changes in the primary metabolism of the three near-isogenic wheat lines after inoculation with the stem rust fungus, namely polyamine content, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate content, respiratory activity, invertase activity, and assimilate contents.

The genetic elements and molecular mechanisms that rule this process have been examined in the long-day-flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana and short-day-flowering rice (Oryza sativa). However, reviews of research on the role of those factors are limited. Here, we focused on how flowering time is influenced by nutrients, ambient temperature, drought, salinity, exogenously applied hormones and chemicals, and pathogenic microbes. In response to such stresses or stimuli, plants either begin flowering to produce seeds for the next generation or else delay flowering by slowing their metabolism. These responses vary depending upon the dose of the stimulus, the plant developmental stage, or even the cultivar that is used. Our review provides insight into how crops might be managed to increase productivity under various environmental challenges.

The use of crops with quantitative disease resistance is expected to alter selection of pathogen life-history traits. This may result in differential adaptation of the pathogen to host cultivars and, sometimes, to the erosion of quantitative resistance. Here, we assessed the level of host adaptation in an oomycete plant pathogenic species. We analysed the phenotypic and genetic variability of 17 Plasmopara viticola isolates collected on Vitis vinifera and 35 isolates from partially resistant varieties (Regent and genotypes carrying the Rpv1 gene). Cross-inoculation experiments assessed two components of aggressiveness and a life-history trait of the pathogen: disease severity, sporangial production and sporangia size. The results contribute evidence to the emergence of P. viticola aggressive isolates presenting a high level of sporulation on the partially resistant Regent. By contrast, no adaptation to the Rpv1 gene was found in this study. The erosion of Regent resistance may have occurred in less than 5 years and at least three times independently in three distant wine-producing areas. Populations from resistant varieties showed a significant increase in sporangia production capacity, indicating an absence of fitness costs for this adaptation. The increase in the number of sporangia was correlated with a reduction in sporangia size, a result which illustrates how partial plant disease resistance can impact selection of the pathogen's life-history traits. This case study on grapevine downy mildew shows how new plant pathogen populations emerge in agro-ecosystems by adapting to partial host resistance. This adaptive pattern highlights the need for wise management of plant partial disease resistance to ensure its sustainability over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The identification of a dilemma of resource allocation associated with plant resources consumed in intrinsic (e.g. metabolic) vs. extrinsic (e.g. symbiotic) stress-tolerance mechanisms could provide a suitable evolutionary reasoning for the apparent dichotomy existing between the hyperaccumulators and AMFplant life-history strategies. Ultimately, it is considered that any efforts toward integrating such biotechnology innovations into bioremediation strategies (e.g. mycorrhizalmetal-hyperaccumulators) should first explicitly consider their inherent environmental and (or) evolutionary contexts to avoid misleading and possibly even unproductive outcomes prior to incorporating these attributes as potential technological solutions.

Isolation of Bacillus spp. entailed screening soil bacteria with potential growth stimulation and plant pathogen suppressive abilities isolated from the rhizospheres and rhizoplanes of vegetable crops. The bacterial colonization of the spermosphere was 90%. When the coated seeds were fully germinated, bacteria moved to the emerging radicle, Virtually no bacteria occurred on the root tip both for the treated and untreated. However, colonization was 20% in the basal portion of the roots close to the seed-root junction. SEM observations showed that the bacterial cells were arranged linearly and laterally on the growing root axis. This phenomenon was more noticeable in the seedlings dipped in the bacterial culture on the 3(rd) day after germination. The results indicate that attachment to the seed coat and the rhizoplane by the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) is an important factor in the successful colonization of the rhizoplane. The significance of the work is to ascertain that the inoculated Bacillus spp. adhered to and established in the rhizoplane of maize. It can therefore be used as a PGPR and as a biocontrol agent.

Fourteen genotypes evalEted on half-sib progenies after natural infection of 2-year-old plants showed comparable rank for rust susceptibility with those evaluated after controlled inoculation of 1-year-old seedlings in a greenhouse. The dynamic of pycnia production was assessed at 2-day intervals in cut-shoot assays under controlled conditions, giving reliable rankings of Scots pine genotypes between years and being significantly correlated with rust susceptibility assessed after natural infection of 2-year-old progenies. These results underlined the importance of some critical factors such as inoculum load and host phenology in the reliability of susceptibility evaluations assessed under different experimental conditions. Artificial inoculation of 1-year-old seedlings in greenhouse experiments could provide a useful early test for the management of Scots pine breeding programmes and study of inheritance of twisting rust susceptibility. However, in specific investigations the cut-shoot assay would constitute a reliable laboratory test for studying host-pathogen interactions and the variability in pathogenicity of Melampsora pinitorqua populations.

Plant and soil responses to defoliation: a comparative study of grass species with contrasting life history strategies	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Defoliation; Microbial biomass; Grassland; Nitrogen cycling; Herbivory; Life history strategies	MICROBIAL BIOMASS; EXTRACTION METHOD; UPLAND GRASSLAND; LOLIUM-PERENNE; FESTUCA-RUBRA; TEMPERATE GRASSLANDS; GRAZING ECOSYSTEM; CARBON ALLOCATION; NARDUS-STRICTA; NITROGEN	The overall aim of this study was to test for inter-species variation in plant and soil responses to defoliation among a broad range of temperate grass species and life-history strategies. We used a microcosm experiment where a range of grass species differing in life history traits were subjected to different intensities of defoliation, and a range of aboveground and belowground plant and soil responses were measured. All plant attributes, including accumulated shoot biomass, root biomass and root length, showed a strong negative response to defoliation, although plant species exhibited subtle differences in the way that they responded to increased severity of defoliation. Defoliation also exerted a strong influence on soil properties, decreasing soil microbial carbon (C) and the soil microbial C:nitrogen (N) ratio, and increasing inorganic N availability and potential N mineralisation across all species. Despite the wide range in life history strategies, plant species did not differ in their influence on most of the soil variables, except for the rate of nitrate mineralisation, which was lowest under plant species that displayed the least relative detrimental responses to defoliation. Collectively, our results suggest that plant and soil responses to defoliation are reasonably consistent across a broad range of grass species, with only subtle inter-specific differences among species.

Warming-induced shift in European mushroom fruiting phenology	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						fungal ecology; Basidiomycetes; agarics; seasonality	CLIMATE-CHANGE	In terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are the major agents of decomposition processes and nutrient cycling and of plant nutrient uptake. Hence, they have a vital impact on ecosystem processes and the terrestrial carbon cycle. Changes in productivity and phenology of fungal fruit bodies can give clues to changes in fungal activity, but understanding these changes in relation to a changing climate is a pending challenge among ecologists. Here we report on phenological changes in fungal fruiting in Europe over the past four decades. Analyses of 746,297 dated and geo-referenced mushroom records of 486 autumnal fruiting species from Austria, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom revealed a widening of the annual fruiting season in all countries during the period 1970-2007. The mean annual day of fruiting has become later in all countries. However, the interspecific variation in phenological responses was high. Most species moved toward a later ending of their annual fruiting period, a trend that was particularly strong in the United Kingdom, which may reflect regional variation in climate change and its effects. Fruiting of both saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi now continues later in the year, but mycorrhizal fungi generally have a more compressed season than saprotrophs. This difference is probably due to the fruiting of mycorrhizal fungi partly depending on cues from the host plant. Extension of the European fungal fruiting season parallels an extended vegetation season in Europe. Changes in fruiting phenology imply changes in mycelia activity, with implications for ecosystem function.

In a previous study, we reported some types of growth abnormalities such as hybrid necrosis and observed hybrid chlorosis with mild or severe abnormalities in wheat triploids obtained in crosses between tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon and four Ae. tauschii accessions and in their derived synthetic hexaploids. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid chlorosis are not well understood. Here, we compared cytology and gene expression in leaves to characterize the abnormal growth in wheat synthetics showing mild and severe chlorosis. In addition, we compared disease resistance to wheat blast fungus. In total 55 and 105 genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and 53 and 89 genes for defense responses were markedly up-regulated in the mild and severe chlorosis lines, respectively. Abnormal chloroplasts formed in the mesophyll cells before the leaves yellowed in the hybrid chlorosis lines. The plants with mild chlorosis showed increased resistance to wheat blast and powdery mildew fungi, although significant differences only in two, third internode length and maturation time, out of the examined agricultural traits were found between the wild type and plants showing mild chlorosis. These observations suggest that senescence might be accelerated in hybrid chlorosis lines of wheat synthetics. Moreover, in wheat synthetics showing mild chlorosis, the negative effects on biomass can be minimized, and they may show substantial fitness under pathogenpolluted conditions.

Both species exhibit very similar phenology, with the timing of litter foliage being the only difference between them. P. praecox litter occurs shortly after the rains, while P. laevigata maintains its leaves until the next wet season. As degradable organic matter (OM) is one of the leading factors determining soil biota composition and activity, because of the OM provided by littering, we expected that the vertical distribution of the microbial community in the vicinity of the root zone of P. praecox would be higher in comparison to P. laevigata. One soil sampling was performed; during the rainy season in August, soil samples were collected from a 0-50-cm depth at 10-cm intervals, in the vicinity of the root canopy of four individual plants of each species and the interspaces between them. Soil moisture, organic matter, and counts of bacteria and fungi under shrubs were found to decrease from the upper to deeper layers. Respiratory activity was higher in the deeper layers (p < 0.01) in all three sampling sites. Total bacterial, fungal, and heterotrophic diazotrophs were found to be significantly (p < 0.001) more numerous under shrubs than in the interspace soil. No nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from interplant soils in comparison to the soil samples collected beneath the shrubs. Heterotrophic diazotrophs significantly (p < 0.01) reduced more acetylene under P. praecox (29.0 nmol/g soil) than under P. laevigata (20.1 nmol/g soil). Although the microbial numbers were unaffected by differences in plant phenology, greater nitrogenase activity under P. praecox may influence nitrogen distribution in this and environment. Due to the fact that only one sampling was undertaken, this study elucidates the differences in the microbial community between the two shrubs, but the dynamics in the above community could not be shown.

However, not all species shift in parallel, which can desynchronize interspecific interactions. Within trophic cascades, herbivores can be top-down controlled by predators or bottom-up controlled by host plant quality and host symbionts, such as plant-associated micro-organisms. Synchronization of trophic levels is required to prevent insect herbivore (pest) outbreaks. In a common garden experiment, we simulated an earlier arrival time (similar to 2 weeks) of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi on its host grass Lolium perenne by enhancing the aphid abundance during the colonization period. L. perenne was either uninfected or infected with the endophytic fungus EpichloA << festucae var. lolii. The plant symbiotic fungus produces insect deterring alkaloids within the host grass. Throughout the season, we tested the effects of enhanced aphid abundance in spring on aphid predators (top-down) and grass-endophyte (bottom-up) responses. Higher aphid population sizes earlier in the season lead to overall higher aphid abundances, as predator occurrence was independent of aphid abundances on the pots. Nonetheless, after predator occurrence, aphids were controlled within 2 weeks on all pots. Possible bottom-up control of aphids by increased endophyte concentrations occurred time delayed after high herbivore abundances. Endophyte-derived alkaloid concentrations were not significantly affected by enhanced aphid abundance but increased throughout the season. We conclude that phenology shifts in an herbivorous species can desynchronize predator-prey and plant-microorganism interactions and might enhance the probability of pest outbreaks with climate change.

Experimentally fermented sausage from goose meat and quality attributes	JOURNAL OF MUSCLE FOODS			English	Article							CHICKEN FRANKFURTERS; TURKEY; SUCUK; BEEF; MANUFACTURE; PLANTS; SALAMI; AFYON; PORK	This research studies various attributes of an experimental fermented goose meat sausage with a view to contributing one more flavor to the product range of the meat industry. In the study, experimental fermented sausages were made from goose meat. Samples were taken from the sausages during the 21-day maturation period in order to determine changes in the product microflora. Microbiologic analyses were conducted and it was found that the total aerobic mesophyl bacteria count in the samples was between 5.0 x 10(4) cju/g and 4.0 x 10(8) cfu/g, the lactobacilli count between 4.7 x 10(3) cfu/g and 2.8 x 10(8) cfu/g, the staphylococ-micrococcus count between 2.6 x 10(3) cfu/g and 1.6 x 10(3) cfu/g and the mold-yeast count between 1.4 x 10(3) cju/g and 2.6 x 10(5) cfu/g. In chemical analyses conducted at the end of the maturation period, the sausages were found to contain 37.2% moisture, 15.8% fat, 27.5% protein, 4.1% ash and to have a pH of 5.2 LA. In a sensorial analysis conducted by a 10-member group of panelists using a 5-point scale, the fermented sausages made from goose meat were compared with. fermented sausages made from raw and cooked beef. The results of the microbiologic, chemical and sensorial analyses conducted on the goose meat sausages were found to be in harmony with the values for maturated beef sausage, leading to the conclusion that goose meat may be used in fermented sausage technology.

J	644		Wasilewska, L				Wasilewska, Lucyna			Changes in the structure of the soil nematode community over long-term secondary grassland succession in drained fen peat	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY			English	Article						nematode succession; natural fens; drained meadows; taxonomic structure; trophic structure; c-p class structure	PINE FOREST SOIL; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; MATURITY INDEX; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; DIVERSITY; FAUNA; ECOSYSTEMS; VEGETATION; EVOLUTION; MEADOWS	The different kind of soil nematode structures, based on the proportions of different orders, trophic groups and individuals belonging to groups with different life history strategies were studied in grasslands transformed by drainage of natural fens, situated at Biebrza Wetland in Poland. Natural fens were studied for comparison with drained meadows, which had a time span from 2 to 117 years after drainage. After conversion of fens into permanent managed meadows, the peat-forming process is replaced by a mucking process (mineralization and humification of peat), accompanied by physicochemical changes in the peat soil. When the nematofauna was classified into nine orders, the most abundant groups on drained meadows were tylenchids (36-84%) and rhabditids (12-39%), followed by araeolaimids, aphelenchids, dorylaimids, enoplids, mononchids, monhysterids and chromadorids. In terms of trophic categories, obligate plant feeders (19-64%) and bacterivores (13-55%) dominated, followed by facultative plant feeders, fungivores, omnivores and predators. Analysis of life history strategy expressed as percentage contribution of c-p classes to total nematodes indicated the dominance of the c-p 2 class, but its contribution decreased with time since drainage, as did the c-p I nematodes. The taxa in c-p 3 did not change, and the contribution of c-p 4 and c-p 5 increased with time. In natural fens, c-p 2 taxa also dominated, followed by c-p 1, c-P 3, c-P 4 and c-p 5 classes. As pulse-stabilized nutrient resources activated mainly by the peat mucking process still exist over succession, although the process rate declines over time, the achievement of a sub-climax state sensu Odum (1969) could be accepted for drained fen meadows. It is proposed that the point at which such a sub-climax state may start is not less than about 65 yearn after drainage, because it coincides with a point, when taxa c-p 4 and c-p 5 approach similar levels of dominance as in natural, undrained fens. The similarities between natural fens and drained sites after 117 years, measured by the Renkonen number, were 85.5, 72 and 77.1% corresponding to three kinds of structures. The maturity index Sigma MI significantly increased in the course of succession (P < 0.001). For considering the construction of Sigma MI over time, individuals of the separate c-p classes were expressed in trophic terms. The temporal changes in abundance of some genera are presented.

Symbiosis lost: Imperfect vertical transmission of fungal endophytes in grasses	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						Neotyphodium; Epichloe; mutualism; Poaceae; herbivory; drought	HORIZONTALLY TRANSMITTED PARASITES; TALL FESCUE; HEREDITARY SYMBIOSIS; FESTUCA-ARUNDINACEA; NEOTYPHODIUM FUNGI; WATER AVAILABILITY; SEED-GERMINATION; LOLIUM-PERENNE; HOST; MUTUALISM	Vertically transmitted symbionts associate with some of the most ecologically dominant species on Earth, and their fixation has led to major evolutionary transitions ( e. g., the development of mitochondria). Theory predicts that exclusive vertical transmission should favor mutualism and generate high frequencies of symbiosis in host populations. However, host populations often support lower-than-expected symbiont frequencies. Imperfect transmission (i.e., symbiont is not transmitted to all offspring) can reduce symbiont frequency, but for most beneficial symbionts it is unknown whether vertical transmission can be imperfect or during which life-history stage the symbiont is lost. Using quantitative natural history surveys of fungal endophytes in grasses, we show that transmission was imperfect in at least one stage for all seven host species examined. Endophytes were lost at all possible stages: within adult plants, from adult tillers to seeds, and from seeds to seedlings. Despite this loss, uninfected seeds failed to germinate in some species, resulting in perfect transmission to seedlings. The type and degree of loss differed among host populations and species and between endophyte genera. Populations with lower endophyte frequencies had higher rates of loss. Our results indicate new directions for understanding cooperation and conflict in symbioses and suggest mechanisms for host sanctions against costly symbionts.

The sparse native vegetation that inhabits Laguna Brava and Mulas Muertas wetlands is frequently colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. It is, however, unknown which AM species can survive in such a harsh environment and how those environmental conditions influence the AM communities. To answer these questions, 454-amplicon pyrosequencing and morphological (based on spore traits) approaches were used to assess fungal diversity. A total of 23 molecular operational taxonomic units and 14 distinct morphospecies of AM fungi were identified. The morphological characterization of AM fungal communities in Laguna Brava and Mulas Muertas, supported by the molecular data, revealed that Glomeraceae and Claroideoglomeraceae were the dominant families, confirming the predominance of generalist and ruderal AM fungal taxa but with stress-tolerant life history traits. Our results showed that the presence of AM fungi is strongly associated with local environmental variations in Laguna Brava (hypersalinity and high Na+, Sr, As and U contents in soils). The AM fungal communities in Laguna Brava and Mulas Muertas wetlands were similar according to the Simpson diversity index and the ecological distance estimated by Bray Curtis index. These results were also supported by the environmental parameters measured, as they did not vary between the studied sites. This study represents the first characterization of AM fungal community in a high-altitude Andean wetland in Argentina, improving our knowledge about these fungi from extreme environments.

Merrill; insecticides; growth; production		Every year, new products are discovered and used for seed treatment in soybeans (Glycine max. L. Merril), aiming to increase production. There is the need to know the influence of the products on the development of plants in order to be succeed in the activity. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of products applied as seed treatment on the morphology of soybean plants at different stages of crop development, as well as the components of income and productivity. The products used were: tiametoxan; [abamectina + tiametoxan + fludioxonil]; [fipronil + tiofanatometilico + piraclostrobina]; [imidacloprido + tiodicarbe]; Cruiser Advanced (R); carboxamida; abamectina; [metalaxyl-M + fludioxonil]; and the control without treatment. In the first step, it was evaluated the physiological quality of treated seed. Subsequently, it was evaluated the initial growth at 15, 30 and 45 days after emergence. In the third stage were evaluated agronomic traits and yield components. The experimental design used for physiological tests of the seeds was randomized and the measurements of early development and late season, were randomized blocks. For statistical analysis, it was used the program SASM-Agri (CANTERI et al., 2001). It was concluded that the mixture of active ingredients insecticides and fungicides affect the early development of soybean seedlings. At 45 days after emergence, there is a positive effect of the products Tiametoxan, [abamectina + tiametoxan + fludioxonil], Cruiser Advanced r and [metalaxyl-M + fludioxonil] on growth, but this stimulus, is not reflected in the final production.

Seedlings (4-6 days after emergence) treated with either acidic dry mycelium extract (DME) or neutralized dry mycelium extract (NDME) were protected against challenge infection with Fom. A single drench with 2-5% DME applied 12-72 h before inoculation provided significant control of the disease compared with water-drenched, challenged seedlings. No protection was seen in plants treated 0-6 h before inoculation or 0-48 h after inoculation. Neither DME nor NDME (0.5-5%) had any effect on fungal growth in vitro, which implied that disease control in vivo was mediated by induced resistance. The resistance induced by DME protected melon plants not only against race 1,2, but also against the three other races of the pathogen, indicating a race-non-specific resistance against Fom. Both DME and NDME significantly increased peroxidase activity and free L-proline content in seedlings 12 h and 48 h after soil drench, respectively. Resistance to Fusarium wilt was significantly associated with elevated levels of peroxidase activity but not with free L-proline content. Thus, peroxidase might be involved in the defense mechanisms activated by DME or NDME.

Minimal genomes of mycoplasma-related endobacteria are plastic and contain host-derived genes for sustained life within Glomeromycota	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						genome contraction; genome plasticity; horizontal gene transfer; vertical transmission	EVOLUTION; RECOMBINATION; SUMOYLATION; BACTERIAL; PROTEINS; REPEATS; FUNGI	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomeromycota) colonize roots of the majority of terrestrial plants. They provide essential minerals to their plant hosts and receive photosynthates in return. All major lineages of AMF harbor endobacteria classified as Mollicutes, and known as mycoplasma-related endobacteria (MRE). Except for their substantial intrahost genetic diversity and ability to transmit vertically, virtually nothing is known about the life history of these endobacteria. To understand MRE biology, we sequenced metagenomes of three MRE populations, each associated with divergent AMF hosts. We found that each AMF species harbored a genetically distinct group of MRE. Despite vertical transmission, all MRE populations showed extensive chromosomal rearrangements, which we attributed to genetic recombination, activity of mobile elements, and a history of plectroviral invasion. The MRE genomes are characterized by a highly reduced gene content, indicating metabolic dependence on the fungal host, with the mechanism of energy production remaining unclear. Several MRE genes encode proteins with domains involved in protein-protein interactions with eukaryotic hosts. In addition, the MRE genomes harbor genes horizontally acquired from AMF. Some of these genes encode small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteases specific to the SUMOylation systems of eukaryotes, which MRE likely use to manipulate their fungal host. The extent of MRE genome plasticity and reduction, along with the large number of horizontally acquired host genes, suggests a high degree of adaptation to the fungal host. These features, together with the ubiquity of the MRE-Glomeromycota associations, emphasize the significance of MRE in the biology of Glomeromycota.

However, reports that have focused only on PSFs may exaggerate the invader's competitiveness. Here, we conducted three experiments to characterize plant-soil-foliage feedbacks, including mature leaves (ML), leaf litter (LL), rhizosphere soil (RS) and leaves plus soil (LS), on the early growth stages of the invasive plant Ageratina adenophora. In general, the feedbacks from aboveground (ML, LL) adversely affected A. adenophora by delaying germination time, inhibiting germination rate and reducing seedling growth. The increased invasion history exacerbated the adverse effects of LL and LS feedbacks on seedling growth. These adverse effects were partially contributed by more abundant fungi (e.g. Didymella) or/and more virulent fungi (e.g. Fusarium) developed in the aboveground part of A. adenophora during the invasion. Interestingly, the aboveground adverse effects can be weakened by microbes from RSs. Our novel findings emphasize the important role of aboveground feedbacks in the evaluation of plant invasiveness, and their commonness and significance remain to be explored in other invasive systems.

We aimed to examine monthly patterns of plant N and microbial N storage during the growing season, and to assess whether N fertilization last applied 30 years ago alters the timing and magnitude of N storage. We measured plant biomass and N, and microbial biomass N monthly during the growing season. We found differences in temporal patterns of plant and microbial N storage in the control plots, with microbial storage higher than plant storage in July, and the opposite trend in September. Unlike the control plots, the plots fertilized 30 years ago exhibited overlapping peaks of N storage in plants and microbes in August. Seasonal trends indicated that rainfall was an important control over plant and microbial activity at the beginning of the growing season, and that temperature limited these activities at the end of the growing season. PFT affected the amount of microbial N, which was in general higher under C3 grasses than other PFTs, independent of fertilization. Historical resource additions increased plant biomass and N, but had little effect on microbial N. These results highlight the complexity of the microbial response. Changes in climate that influence precipitation timing will affect the temporal pattern for microbial biomass N, while management practices resulting in altered plant community composition will influence the magnitude of microbial biomass N.

M. festucae cerealium is an economic pest of wheat and barley that has recently been found in high population densities in wheat in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. BYDV-PAV is the most prevalent and injurious species of BYDV worldwide and in the Pacific Northwest. Although M. festucae sensu stricto (Theobald 1917) has been reported previously as a vector of some BYDV isolates, there is no confirmed transmission of BYDV by M. festucae cerealium. Two experiments examined the ability of M. festucae cerealium to transmit BYDV-PAV. The first used single aphids caged to indicator plants of a BYDV-susceptible winter wheat cultivar and the second used multiple aphids on each test plant. M. festucae cerealium did not transmit BYDV-PAV in either experiment, whereas transmission by a known BYDV vector, Rhopalosiphum padi L., was consistently high (>= 93%). A third experiment compared the intrinsic growth rate, days until first reproduction and daily reproduction by M. festucae cerealium on sham-inoculated and BYDV-PAV-infected wheat, but detected no differences. The findings are reviewed in light published data on M. festucae species, BYDV transmission, and the potential pest status of this new invading aphid.	[Sadeghi, S.

Don, a rich source of terpenoid indole alkaloids	PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE			English	Article						AgNO3; Catharanthus; In vitro flowering; Periwinkle; Multiple shoot proliferation	ETHYLENE INHIBITOR; TISSUE-CULTURES; REGENERATION; MICROPROPAGATION; METABOLISM; AJMALICINE	Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don is an economically and medicinally important plant since its leaves and flowers contain terpenoid indole alkaloids. The present study, for the first time, encompasses the influence of silver nitrate (AgNO3), in consort with cytokinins like N (6)-benzyladenine (BA) and 6-furfurylaminopurine (kinetin), to regenerate multiple shoots from nodal segments explants and to induce high-frequency precocious flowering of C. roseus under in vitro condition. Synergistic effect of equal concentrations of BA and kinetin was enhanced following the amalgamation of AgNO3. As high as 98% explants responded to multiple shoot initiation and proliferation in Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 3 A mu M BA, 3 A mu M kinetin and 0.1 A mu M AgNO3. As many as 7 shoots were developed per explant following 12 days of inoculation. Continuous culture in the same medium for 21 days induced precocious flowering from 75% shoots, wherein a maximum of similar to 6 (5.67 +/- 0.88) flowers was observed per in vitro shoot. On the other hand, in the combinations of BA and kinetin excluding AgNO3, a maximum of 6.67% explants responded and initiated merely 3.33 shoots per explant. Nevertheless, no induction of flower was observed in the media devoid of AgNO3. Our results on the induction and proliferation of multiple shoots with simultaneous flowering would help the global pharmaceutical industry to produce in vitro shoots and flowers in bulk, as an alternative source of alkaloids.

Molecular Dating of the Emergence of Anaerobic Rumen Fungi and the Impact of Laterally Acquired Genes	MSYSTEMS			English	Article						comparative genomics; divergence time estimation; evolution; HGT; phylogenomics	HORIZONTALLY TRANSFERRED GENES; PHYLUM NEOCALLIMASTIGOMYCOTA; GENOME SEQUENCE; EARLY EVOLUTION; REVEALS; PROTEIN; CHYTRIDIOMYCOTA; GENERATION; ALIGNMENT; BIOMASS	The anaerobic gut fungi (AGF), or Neocallimastigomycota, inhabit the rumen and alimentary tract of herbivorous mammals, where they play important roles in the degradation of plant fiber. Comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses of the AGF have long been hampered by their fastidious growth condition, as well as their large (up to 200 Mb) and AT-biased (78 to 84%) genomes. We sequenced 21 AGF transcriptomes and combined them with 5 available AGF genome sequences to explore their evolutionary relationships, time their divergence, and characterize gene gain/loss patterns associated with their evolution. We estimate that the most recent common ancestor of the AGF diverged 66 (+/- 10) million years ago, a time frame that coincides with the evolution of grasses (Poaceae), as well as the mammalian transition from insectivory to herbivory. The concordance of independent estimations suggests that AGF have been important in shaping the success of mammalian herbivory transition by improving the efficiency of energy acquisition from recalcitrant plant materials. Comparative genomics identified multiple lineage-specific genes in the AGF, two of which were acquired from rumen gut bacteria and animal hosts via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). A third AGF domain, plant-like polysaccharide lyase, represents a novel gene in fungi that potentially aids AGF to degrade pectin. Analysis of genomic and transcriptomic sequences confirmed both the presence and expression of these lineage-specific genes in nearly all AGF clades. These genetic elements may contribute to the exceptional abilities of AGF to degrade plant biomass and enable metabolism of the rumen microbes and animal hosts. IMPORTANCE Anaerobic fungi living in the rumen of herbivorous mammals possess an extraordinary ability to degrade plant biomass. We examined the origin and genomic composition of these poorly characterized anaerobic gut fungi using both transcriptome and genomic data. Phylogenomics and molecular dating analyses found remarkable concurrence of the divergence times of the rumen fungi, the forage grasses, and the dietary shift of ancestral mammals from primarily insectivory to herbivory. Comparative genomics identified unique machinery in these fungi to utilize plant polysaccharides. The rumen fungi were also identified with the ability to code for three protein domains with putative functions in plant pectin degradation and microbial defense, which were absent from all other fungal organisms (examined over 1,000 fungal genomes). Two of these domains were likely acquired from rumen gut bacteria and animal hosts separately via horizontal gene transfer. The third one is a plant-like polysaccharide lyase, representing a unique fungal enzyme with potential pectin breakdown abilities.

Invasion of Rosa rugosa induced changes in soil nutrients and microbial communities of coastal sand dunes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Plant invasion; Rasa rugosa; Coastal sand dunes; Soil microbial communities; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Element concentration	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOLIDAGO-GIGANTEA; PLANT INVASIONS; FATTY-ACIDS; NITROGEN; IMPACTS; BIOMASS; METAANALYSIS; PERFORMANCE; PHOSPHORUS	The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of R. rugosa invasion on soil physicochemical and microbial properties of coastal sand dunes. The study was performed at 25 paired invaded-native plots along the Hel Peninsula at the coast of the Baltic Sea. A number of soil physicochemical and microbial parameters were measured. namely organic matter layer thickness, pH, electrical conductivity, organic C, total Ca, N, Na, P, N-NH4, N-NO3 and P-PO4 concentrations, phospholipid and neutral fatty acid (PLFA, NLFA) markers of total microbial, bacterial, fungal biomass and microbial community structure, as well as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore and species numbers, and the degree of AMF root colonization. Since potential alterations in soil parameters induced by R rugosa may be related to large amounts of secondary metabolites provided to the soil with litter or root exudates, total phenolic concentration in senescing tissues of R. rugosa and native species was compared. Rosa rugosa invasion was associated with increased organic C, total N and P-PO4 concentrations in mineral soil relative to native vegetation. Organic matter layer under R. rugosa was thicker, had higher pH and Ca concentration. Rosa rugosa invasion was associated with reduced total microbial, bacterial and G+ bacterial biomass and increased AMF biomass markers (16:1 omega 5 NLFA and 16:1 omega 5 NLFA/PLFA), and changes in microbial community structure in mineral soil. The reduction in total and bacterial biomass under R. rugosa might have been related to the production of secondary metabolites as total phenolic concentration was approx. 5 times higher in senescing tissues of R. rugosa than in native vegetation. The observed increase in element concentrations and alterations in microbial community structure suggest that invasion of R. rugosa may threaten nutrient-poor habitats of coastal dunes. Changes in the soil environment may hinder restoration of these valuable habitats after invader removal. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One of the most common culture methodologies is in vitro asymbiotic germination, in which the nutritional conditions that provide orchids with a fungal partner are emulated. Although Chile possesses more than 60 terrestrial orchid species, in vitro cultivation protocols have only been developed for Chloraea crispa. In Southern Chile, Chloraea gavilu stands out due to its floral characteristics. We evaluate different explants and cultivation conditions for C. gavilu. The best germination and development results were achieved in the MM medium +0.1% yeast extract +1% sucrose +0.454 mu mol l(-1) TDZ, using immature seeds of 24-30 days after pollination, which we cultivated into seedlings in order to be acclimatized and mycorrhized. In addition, induction of protocorm-like bodies was achieved from germinated seeds, using the same culture media as in the germination and development of immature C. gavilu seeds. This resulted in the successful asymbiotic germination of immature seeds, along with the micropropagation of a terrestrial, temperate orchid. We hope to use our protocol in the commercial production of Chilean orchid species as well as to propagate threatened species.

Plant-fungal interactions can have strong effects on plant abundances, both through direct effects on plant performance and indirect effects on competition and facilitation. Most evidence linking fungi to plant abundances derives from direct fungal effects on initial growth, with little evidence linking fungal effects on plant-plant interactions in intact communities to plant abundances for any plant life-history stage. 2. We transplanted 4320 individuals belonging to 18 plant species into plots where we removed neighbouring vegetation and suppressed fungi using fungicide in a factorial design. We monitored plant survival and growth for 3 years, using these data to test whether fungi had net effects on how plant-plant interactions affected different plant life-history components (initial survival/growth, adult survival/growth). We then tested whether these indirect fungal effects or direct fungal effects on plant performance best explained plant commonness (frequency of occurrence) and local density (per cent cover). Finally, we measured differences in root-associated fungi following fungal suppression and associated these differences with fungal effects on plant performance. 3. Overall, fungi increased competitive effects on survival (i.e. lower survival with fungi intact), but reduced competitive effects on growth of adult plants (i.e. higher growth when fungi intact). Among the focal species, these indirect fungal effects increased survival for more common species relative to rarer species. However, indirect fungal effects on adult growth benefitted rarer species more than common species. Local plant densities were unassociated with indirect fungal effects, but were negatively associated with direct fungal effects on survival and adult growth. This suggests that fungi limit local dominance, thereby indirectly increasing the establishment of common species and the growth of rare species. 4. Synthesis. Using a variety of plant species and suppressing both fungi and neighbours, we show that fungi have net indirect effects, through plant-plant interactions, within intact plant communities. Variation among species in both direct and indirect fungal effects contributed to plant abundances, yet fungal effects did not consistently benefit either common or rare species. However, regardless of commonness, fungi directly reduced growth and survival for species with high local densities, consistent with plant-soil feedbacks limiting species dominance.

This hypothesis is based on scant experimental evidence, and to test it we examined the effect of abiotic factors on the Arabidopsis thaliana-Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) interaction. Four Arabidopsis genotypes clustering into two allometric groups were grown under six environments defined by three temperature and two light-intensity conditions. Plants were either CMV-infected or mock-inoculated, and the effects of environment and infection on temporal and resource allocation life-history traits were quantified. Life-history traits significantly differed between allometric groups over all environments, with group 1 plants tolerating abiotic stress better than those of group 2. The effect of CMV infection on host fitness (virulence) differed between genotypes, being lower in group 1 genotypes. Tolerance to abiotic stress and to infection was similarly achieved through life-history trait responses, which resulted in resource reallocation from growth to reproduction. Effects of infection varied according to plant genotype and environment from detrimental to beneficial for host fitness.

Do soil microbes and abrasion by soil particles influence persistence and loss of physical dormancy in seeds of tropical pioneers?	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Barro Colorado Island; germination cue; physical dormancy; pioneer plants; seed dormancy loss; seed persistence; soil seed bank	RAIN-FOREST; RECRUITMENT LIMITATION; SEEDLING SURVIVAL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GERMINATION; DIVERSITY; LIGHT; TEMPERATURE; DISPERSAL; DYNAMICS	Germination from the soil seed bank (SSB) is an important determinant of species composition in tropical forest gaps, with seed persistence in the SSB allowing trees to recruit even decades after dispersal. The capacity to form a persistent SSB is often associated with physical dormancy, where seed coats are impermeable at the time of dispersal. Germination literature often speculates, without empirical evidence, that dormancy-break in physically dormant seeds is the result of microbial action and/or abrasion by soil particles. We tested the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis in four widely distributed neotropical pioneer tree species (Apeiba membranacea, Luehea seemannii, Ochroma pyramidale, and Cochlospermum vitifolium). Seeds were buried in five common gardens in a lowland tropical forest in Panama, and recovered at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after burial. Seed permeability, microbial infection, seed coat thickness, and germination were measured. Parallel experiments compared the germination fraction of fresh and aged seeds without soil contact, and in seeds as a function of seed permeability. Contrary to the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis the proportion of permeable seeds, and of seeds infected by cultivable microbes, decreased as a function of burial duration. Furthermore, seeds stored in dark and dry conditions for 2 years showed a higher proportion of seed germination than fresh seeds in identical germination conditions. We determined that permeable seeds of A. membranacea and O. pyramidale had cracks in the chalazal area or lacked the chalazal plug, whereas all surfaces of impermeable seeds were intact. Our results are inconsistent with the microbial/soil abrasion hypothesis of dormancy loss and instead suggest the existence of multiple dormancy phenotypes, where a fraction of each seed cohort is dispersed in a permeable state and germinates immediately, while the impermeable seed fraction accounts for the persistent SSB. Thus, we conclude that fluctuations in the soil temperature in the absence of soil abrasion and microbial infection are sufficient to break physical dormancy on seeds of tropical pioneer trees.

Avola) to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM) species Glomus mosseae and Glomus intraradices and Rhizobium leguminosarum by. viceae, strain D 293, regarding the growth, photosynthesis, nodulation and nitrogen fixation activity. Pea plants were grown in a glasshouse until the flowering stage (35 days), in 4 kg plastic pots using leached cinnamonic forest soil (Chromic Luvisols FAO) at P levels 13.2 (P1) and 39.8 (P2) mg P/kg soil. The obtained results demonstrated that the dual inoculation of pea plants significantly increased the plant biomass, photosynthetic rate, nodulation, and nitrogen fixation activity in comparison with single inoculation with Rhizobium leguminosarum by. viceae strain D 293. On the other hand, coinoculation significantly increased the total phosphorus content in plant tissue, acid phosphatase activity and percentage of root colonization. The effectiveness of coinoculation with Rhizobium leguminosarum and Glomus mosseae was higher at the low phosphorus level while the coinoculation with Glomus intraradices appeared to be the most effective at higher phosphorus level.

Spores of vesicular arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi in the soil were reduced by 25% after selective logging and by 75% after heavy logging. VA infection in the roots of plants persisting on, or colonizing, a heavily logged site was reduced by up to 75%. The most probable number (MPN) of VA propagules in sieved soil was up to ten times greater than spore density, but was also greatly reduced by heavy logging. This resulted in reduced infectivity of soil from the heavily logged site, as demonstrated by reduced VA infection of bioassay plants. The infectivity of soil declined following sun drying, but sun-dried soil devoid of vegetation retained some infectivity even after 12 months storage. Overall the data suggest that root and hyphal fragments are more important than spores as inoculum in disturbed forest, and that in undisturbed forest living roots and hyphae are likely to be important sources of infection. In a pot experiment, shoot growth of two test species, Albizia falcataria (L.) Becker and Parkia speciosa Hassk. responded more to VA mycorrhizal infection than to P fertilization over the range 0-6 g triple superphosphate per 8 kg of soil. The response to inoculation with a cocktail of 'introduced' VA fungi propagated in pot cultures was greater than the response to inoculation with 'indigenous' fungi propagated in pot cultures from roots and soil collected in undisturbed forests. Another test species, Intsia palembanica Miq., also responded better to mycorrhizal infection than to P fertilization, and better to VA mycorrhizal infection than to ectomycorrhizal infection. Intsia palembanica seedlings growing around mature dipterocarps quickly became ectomycorrhizal, suggesting that at least some ectomycorrhizal fungi infect both dipterocarps and Intsia. Shorea leprosula Miq. seedlings growing naturally in the forest had ectomycorrhizas 20 days after germination, i.e. before they had true leaves, and within 7 months supported up to 11 different ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, seedlings isolated from contact with the roots of mature Shorea trees remained uninfected in the field for up to 6 months. This shows the importance of contact with living ectomycorrhizal roots for early infection of dipterocarp seedlings, a point which should be recognized in logging operations and forest regeneration programmes.

Plant nutritionists are in search of substitutes to mineral fertilizers or the way that enhance the efficiency of mineral fertilizers or to compensate / supplement the mineral fertilizers. Rhizobium is very well recognized due to its symbiotic relationship with legumes has now been used in non-legumes due to its great root colonization ability, growth hormone production potential, improving the nutrient use efficiency, P-solubilization and inducing systemic resistance. Precursor-inoculum interaction provide constant source of hormones to plants and improved the growth and yield of cereals. Field studies were planned to ascertain the role of microbial biosynthesis of auxins through L-TRP on auxins production potential and wheat growth. Different Rhizobium species were isolated and screened out for their auxin production potential and root / shoot elongation assay was carried out. Two N levels i.e. 80 and 120 kg ha(-1) as urea was used while uniform rate of P (as SSP) and K (as SOP) i.e. 115 and 60 kg ha(-1) were used and L-TRP @ 10(-5) M was applied as seed soaking for three hours. Results revealed that precursor-inoculum interaction has affected the yield parameters of wheat as compared to their separate application. Precursor-inoculum interaction produced highest grain yield of wheat at Soil Bacteriology Section, Soil Chemistry Section (Institute of Soil Chemistry & Environmental Sciences, ISC&ES) Faisalabad i.e. 5689, 5827 and 5042, 5292 kg ha(-1) at 80 and 120 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Other growth parameters, soil-plant analyses were also improved by the approach of precursor-inoculum interaction. Precursor-inoculum interaction exhibited higher IAA equivalents in the rhizosphere soil of wheat determined at 15 and 30 days after germination.	[Qureshi, M. A.; Mujeeb, F.; Ali, M. A.; Anjum, M.

We used a process-based ecosystem model (PALS) that was modified, parameterized, and evaluated for a Mojave Desert ecosystem in the southwestern US to simulate how dryland soil respiration (R-s) and soil C pool size responded to precipitation changes at multiple temporal scales. The effects of changing precipitation on R-s were largely mediated by the contrasting respiratory response of plants (R-a) and soil microbes (R-h) and confounded by predrought duration, season, soil temperature, plant phenology, and substrate availability. Increases in precipitation amount stimulated R-s and increased the contribution of R-a to R-s, whereas reductions in summer rainfall and strong increases in rainfall event size reduced total R-s and decreased the contribution of R-a to R-s. Increases in annual rainfall and decreases in summer rainfall benefited dryland soil C sequestration, whereas strong increases in rainfall event size resulted in a loss of soil C, with labile soil C pools being more responsive to precipitation regime changes than recalcitrant C pools at a decadal scale. These simulation results implied that dryland soils may act as C sinks with increased precipitation amount or C sources with decreased precipitation amount, but the strength of the sink/source may be mediated by accompanying shifts in rainfall seasonality and event size distribution.

Each accession was evaluated at least twice. Eleven accessions exhibited grain mold severity ratings of 2 or less, indicating that they were resistant to highly resistant to the disease when challenged withA. alternataalone, 7 lines identified as such when inoculated with a mixture ofA. alternata,F.thapsinum, andC. lunata, and 17 resistant lines were identified under the untreated control. Three lines PI533871, PI576130, and PI656036 exhibited resistant to highly resistant response to grain mold across treatments. When the 10 subpopulations were compared for disease response, accessions within subpopulation 4 had the lowest overall grain mold severity ratings, indicating that this subpopulation (zerazera/caudatum racial type) harbors genes that may contribute to grain mold resistance. A genome-wide association study with over 79,000 single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci from a publicly available genotype by sequencing dataset available for the (SAP) lines was conducted to identify genomic regions associated with grain mold resistance response based on the individual and combined treatments. In most cases, the top-scoring SNPs were mapped to the nearest or a nearby annotated gene with precedence for a role in host defense.

Asexual Fungal Symbionts Alter Reproductive Allocation and Herbivory over Time in Their Native Perennial Grass Hosts	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						defensive mutualist; endophyte; herbivores; life history; resource allocation; tolerance	ARIZONA FESCUE; NEOTYPHODIUM ENDOPHYTES; ECOLOGICAL COSTS; LOLIUM-PERENNE; TALL FESCUE; RESISTANCE; TOLERANCE; GROWTH; INFECTION; CONTINUUM	Although most plants harbor microbial symbionts, the temporal effects of symbionts on resource allocation and herbivore resistance of perennial hosts are unknown. Neotyphodium endophytes are asexual, vertically transmitted fungal symbionts of grasses that are thought to interact mutualistically with their hosts, mainly by deterring herbivores. To test age-specific effects of Neotyphodium infection and herbivory on resource allocation, I conducted a 4-year field experiment with four genotypes of an infected perennial native grass from which the endophyte was removed and for which herbivory and water availability were controlled. In the absence of herbivory, infection increased allocation to reproductive effort in the first two growing seasons. Infected plants also flowered earlier. Herbivory increased allocation to reproduction in the first year but much more so in infected than in uninfected plants. Infected plants also had greater herbivore loads in early stages, suggesting that infected plants are more tolerant to herbivory. Asexual fungal symbionts thus fundamentally alter host resource allocation and resistance and tolerance to herbivores over time. Increased reproductive effort in early host ontogeny should benefit the symbiont by increasing transmission but perhaps at the expense of lifetime host fitness. If so, then the conventional notion of asexual endophytes as mutualistic hostages of their hosts is incorrect.

J	669		Yamagishi, N; Kishigami, R; Yoshikawa, N				Yamagishi, Noriko; Kishigami, Ryusuke; Yoshikawa, Nobuyuki			Reduced generation time of apple seedlings to within a year by means of a plant virus vector: a new plant-breeding technique with no transmission of genetic modification to the next generation	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Apple latent spherical virus vector; early flowering; apple seedling; reduction in generation time; new breeding technique	LATENT-SPHERICAL-VIRUS; FLOWERING-LOCUS-T; X DOMESTICA BORKH.; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; EXPRESSION PATTERNS; JUVENILE PHASE; TFL1-LIKE GENE; LONG-DISTANCE; FT; PROTEIN	Fruit trees have a long juvenile phase. For example, the juvenile phase of apple (Malus x domestica) generally lasts for 5-12years and is a serious constraint for genetic analysis and for creating new apple cultivars through cross-breeding. If modification of the genes involved in the transition from the juvenile phase to the adult phase can enable apple to complete its life cycle within 1year, as seen in herbaceous plants, a significant enhancement in apple breeding will be realized. Here, we report a novel technology that simultaneously promotes expression of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T gene (AtFT) and silencing of apple TERMINAL FLOWER 1 gene (MdTFL1-1) using an Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) vector (ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1) to accelerate flowering time and life cycle in apple seedlings. When apple cotyledons were inoculated with ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1 immediately after germination, more than 90% of infected seedlings started flowering within 1.5-3months, and almost all early-flowering seedlings continuously produced flower buds on the lateral and axillary shoots. Cross-pollination between early-flowering apple plants produced fruits with seeds, indicating that ALSV-AtFT/MdTFL1 inoculation successfully reduced the time required for completion of the apple life cycle to 1year or less. Apple latent spherical virus was not transmitted via seeds to successive progenies in most cases, and thus, this method will serve as a new breeding technique that does not pass genetic modification to the next generation.

Additionally, climatic variability might modify trait selection in fungi, including spore size and dispersal characteristics. Compositional and trait modifications of fungal communities would have important consequences for fungal biogeography, interactions with plant communities, and ecosystem functions. In this study, we analysed long-term fungal sporocarp community structure and dynamics in response to climate change and variability. We tested whether observed changes in the fungal sporocarp community related to climate, temporal or spatial differences among plots. Fungal trait associations with climatic variables were tested. Climate and endogenous patterns of succession each significantly affected composition, with regional variance in the affecting climate variables. Evidence for climate-driven reproductive trait selection related to spore dimensions, spore-bearing surfaces, and mode of fungal nutrition. Future research should then prioritize examining the impacts of climate on spore production and dispersal, plus other fungal traits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

Among them stand out from the gray leaf spot and white spot. This study was therefore to evaluate the effect of applying a fungicide, which has as active ingredient mancozeb, productivity of maize hybrids, and check its efficiency in controlling foliar diseases Cercospora leaf spot and white spot. The experiment was conducted in the agricultural year 2011/2012, in the experimental farm of IFSULDEMINAS Campus Inconfidentes. To conduct the study were selected hybrids used in accordance with the levels of resistance to disease. The design was done in randomized block design with three replications in a factorial design, which evaluated 8 (hybrid) x 3 fungicide applications. Seven visual assessments of disease severity were held from the 90 days after emergence, through grade scale ranging from 1 (highly resistant) to 9 (highly susceptible). The grains were collected to obtain the yield of hybrids, and moisture was adjusted to 13%. The application of fungicide was effective in controlling the diseases white spot and Cercospora leaf spot, however, did not increase grain yield of hybrids used in this experiment. The application of fungicide in V6 and pre-bolting of corn plants was more efficient.

Phylloplane bacteria increase the negative impact of food limitation on insect fitness	ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Egg quality; emergent effects; fecundity; induced defences; Pseudomonas; starvation	WESTERN TENT CATERPILLAR; EGG SIZE; DISEASE RESISTANCE; LIFE-HISTORY; GYPSY-MOTH; RNA INTERFERENCE; TRICHOPLUSIA-NI; RED ALDER; LEPIDOPTERA; IMMUNITY	1. When populations of herbivorous insects increase in density, they can alter the quantity or quality of their food. The impacts of diet-related stressors on insect fitness have been investigated singly, but not simultaneously. 2. Foliage quantity and quality of red alder, Alnus rubra, were manipulated together with the presence of non-entomopathogenic phylloplane bacteria to investigate their impacts, singly and in combination, on survival, pupal mass, growth rate, fecundity and egg quality of a cyclic forest insect, the western tent caterpillar, Malacosoma californicum pluviale. 3. Food limitation (half food) had strong negative impacts on all life-history traits. When the larvae were fed continuously, however, neither ingesting phylloplane bacteria nor eating leaves from damaged branches (induced foliage) affected survival. In the half-food treatment, ingesting bacteria further increased mortality, while feeding on induced foliage improved survival. 4. Growth rate and pupal mass of both sexes were reduced for larvae with food limitation compared with continuously fed insects and this was exacerbated when the larvae also ate bacteria-treated leaves. A combination of bacteria and induced foliage also reduced larval growth rate by 5% in the full-food treatment. 5. Fecundity (eggs per egg mass) was 2.7 times greater in full-food than in food-limited treatments but neither phylloplane bacteria nor plant induction had an effect. Insects fed induced foliage produced smaller eggs. Overall, there was no evidence of a three-way interaction between the three stressors, although there were negative synergistic effects, primarily between food limitation and the ingestion of phylloplane bacteria.

The total number of fungal species infecting each grass species, as well as numbers of smuts, rusts, and systemic clavicipitaceous fungi, were compiled. Host characteristics included grass subfamily, the number of species in the genus, geographic range, life history, and their status as native versus alien species, and crop versus noncrop species. Analyses indicated that the best predictor of pathogen species richness per host is host geographical range. Grass subfamily, life history, and status as crops or native species also were significantly correlated with pathogen load but explained less variation than host geographical range. Pathogen species richness per host showed a strong trend to increase with increasing latitude. Extensive sampling of fungal pathogens from selected grass species is needed to provide an independent measure of accuracy of the data base.

Strains showed in vitro antibiosis against the test fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum together with plant growth-promotion properties that included indole-3-acetic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and inorganic phosphorus solubilization production. The activities of stress responsive enzymes that included lipoxygenase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase were reported in bacteria and control-treated soybean plants. Bacteria treated seeds showed higher enzymatic activities in leaves in comparison with fungal spore treated seeds and were considered as positive control. Treatment with bacteria resulted in remarkable increase in the chlorophyll content in leaves as compared to water (negative control) and fungal spore treated seeds (P < 0.05). Soybean seeds treated with bacteria were subjected to fungal spore stress at 0 day after seeding, strain SJ(5) significantly enhanced emergence at 28 days after seeding than other treated seeds and positive control. The fresh weight of both shoot and root of plant was significantly increased when soybean seeds were treated with bacteria in the presence of fungal spores as compared to positive control. The dry weights of both roots and shoots were significantly increased by the bacterial treatments as compared to positive control (P < 0.05). Strain treated seeds significantly enhanced root and shoot length together with a number of lateral roots when spore suspension was applied at 0 day after seeding. Moreover, soybean plants treated with strain SJ(5) exhibited significantly greater root and shoot weights as compared to the other treated plants when fungal spore suspension was applied at 0 day after seeding.

The composting is recognized as a suitable method for sludge recycling.. The effect of tannery sludge compost (TSC) rates on growth, nodulation and N fixation of cowpea was investigated. Sandy and clayey soils were amended with TSC at rates of 0, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 t ha(-1). The shoot dry weight of cowpea plants 45 days after emergence (DAE) was greater in the TSC-amended than in the unamended soil. In the sandy soil, nodule dry weight increased with TSC application 45 DAE. In the clayey soil, 45 DAE, nodule dry weight decreased with TSC amendment levels greater than 7.5 t ha(-1) compared to the unamended control. The application of TSC increased N accumulation in the cowpea plants. The results suggest that cowpea responds differently to TSC depending on the amendment rate and initial soil type.

Both field naturally infected and experimentally infected psyllids were evaluated. The capacity of the different life stages of the insect in transmitting AP was tested. Overwintered adults collected in the orchards were able to transmit AP with a variable efficiency, depending on the infectivity rate of source plants. Experimentally infected nymphs and springtime adults succeeded in the transmission of AP, but the lower number of insect tested and the shorter inoculation period, due to difficulties in rearing the whole cycle of the insect in the laboratory, affected the efficiency. Considering the life history of C. melanoneura, the over-wintered adults are the most responsible of the diffusion of AP in apple orchards.

Elizabeth			A novel proof of concept for capturing the diversity of endophytic fungi preserved in herbarium specimens	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						foliar endophytes; fungi; global change; herbaria; plant specimens; plant microbiome	BIOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NEW-ENGLAND; PLANT; DNA; COMMUNITIES; HOST; AMPLIFICATION; EXTRACTION; PATTERNS	Herbarium specimens represent important records of morphological and genetic diversity of plants that inform questions relevant to global change, including species distributions, phenology and functional traits. It is increasingly appreciated that plant microbiomes can influence these aspects of plant biology, but little is known regarding the historic distribution of microbes associated with plants collected in the pre-molecular age. If microbiomes can be observed reliably in herbarium specimens, researchers will gain a new lens with which to examine microbial ecology, evolution, species interactions. Here, we describe a method for accessing historical plant microbiomes from preserved herbarium specimens, providing a proof of concept using two plant taxa from the imperiled boreal biome (Andromeda polifolia and Ledum palustre subsp. groenlandicum, Ericaceae). We focus on fungal endophytes, which occur within symptomless plant tissues such as leaves. Through a three-part approach (i.e. culturing, cloning and next-generation amplicon sequencing via the Illumina MiSeq platform, with extensive controls), we examined endophyte communities in dried, pressed leaves that had been processed as regular herbarium specimens and stored at room temperature in a herbarium for four years. We retrieved only one endophyte in culture, but cloning and especially the MiSeq analysis revealed a rich community of foliar endophytes. The phylogenetic distribution and diversity of endophyte assemblages, especially among the Ascomycota, resemble endophyte communities from fresh plants collected in the boreal biome. We could distinguish communities of endophytes in each plant species and differentiate likely endophytes from fungi that could be surface contaminants. Taxa found by cloning were observed in the larger MiSeq dataset, but species richness was greater when subsets of the same tissues were evaluated with the MiSeq approach.

Physiological and phenological responses of oak seedlings to oak forest soil in the absence of trees	TREE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						mycorrhiza; phenology; photosynthesis; Quercus ellipsoidalis; tree-seedling interactions	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SAPLING GROWTH; LEAF PHENOLOGY; LIGHT; COMPETITION; CARBON; WATER; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; AVAILABILITY	Established trees influence the growth and physiology of seedlings by altering above- and belowground conditions; however, tree influences on seedling physiology via belowground interactions are not well understood. We used soil transfers to an open field to examine the belowground influences of a Quercus ellipsoidalis E.J.Hill dominated forest on Q. ellipsoidalis seedling mycorrhizal infection, nutrient uptake, growth and photosynthesis over three years. After two years, seedlings planted with large quantities of forest soil (HF treatment) had greater leaf mass and foliar N concentrations than seedlings receiving smaller quantities of forest soil (LF) and control treatments. Mycorrhizal infection was greater in the HF treatment after one year compared with the LF and control treatments, with a positive correlation of foliar N and mycorrhizal infection in Year 2. There were marked effects of treatments on seedling spring phenology with HF seedlings breaking bud up to 17 days earlier than seedlings in the other treatments. The HF seedlings also had more rapid leaf expansion and larger leaves, and an increase in net photosynthetic rates. These results highlight complex linkages between above- and belowground physiology: forest soil had substantial effects on seedling physiology, including traits such as phenology that have previously been considered to be under aboveground control. Belowground influences of trees on conspecific seedlings may play a critical role in early seedling establishment.

This study aimed to investigate at the histochemical level if silicon (Si) could enhance the production of flavonoids in the leaves of wheat plants in response to P. oryzae infection. Plants from the Alianca cultivar, which are susceptible to blast, were grown in hydroponic cultures containing O (-Si) or 2 mM of Si (+Si) and inoculated by spraying a conidial suspension of P. oryzae (1 x 10(5) conidia mL(-1)) on all adaxial leaf surfaces of plants at 60 days after emergence (growth stage 65). The fourth and fifth leaves of each plant were used to evaluate blast severity at 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 h after inoculation (hai). At 96 hai, leaves were collected from plants to determine the foliar Si concentration. For cytological observations, leaf samples were randomly collected from the fourth and fifth leaves of each plant at 72 hai. The foliar Si concentration was higher in +Si plants (36 g kg(-1)) in comparison to -Si plants (2.6 g kg(-1)). This increased Si concentration was correlated with reduced fungal growth inside the epidermal cells and the development of blast symptoms on leaves. Strong fluorescence, which is an indication of the presence of flavonoids, was detected in the leaf cells of +Si plants using Neu's and Wilson's reagents. A novel item of evidence is that, at the histochemical level, Si is involved in the potentiation of the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids that increases wheat resistance to blast.

Pulse labeling of carbon dioxide ((CO2)-C-13) coupled with stable isotope probing techniques have potential to track recently fixed photosynthate into rhizosphere microbial taxa. Therefore, the present investigation assessed the microbial community change associated with the rhizosphere and bulk soil in Jatropha curcas L. (a biofuel crop) by combining phospholipid fatty acid (C-13-PLFA) profiling using a stable isotope (CO2)-C-13 labeling approach. The labeling (C-13) took place after 45 days of germination, PLFAs were extracted from both soils (rhizosphere and bulk) after 1 and 20 days pulse labeling and analyzed by gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. There was no significant temporal effect on the PLFA profiles in the bulk soil, but significantly increased abundance of Gram positive (i15:0) and Gram negative (16:1 omega 7c and 16:1 omega 5c) biomarkers was observed in the rhizosphere soil from day 1 to day 20 after labeling. The Gram negative (16:1 omega 7c) decreased and fungal (18:2 omega 6,9c) increased significantly in rhizospheric soil compared to bulk soil after day 1 of labeling. Whereas, after 20 days of labeling, the Gram negative biomarker (16:1 omega 7c and 18:1 omega 7c) decreased and Gram positive (a15:0) increased significantly in rhizospheric soil compared to bulk soil. One day following labeling, i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, 16:1.5c, 16:0, i17:0, a17:0, 18:2.6,9c, 18:1.9c, and 18:0 PLFAs were significantly more enriched in delta C-13 in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. Twenty days after labeling, 16:1 omega 5c (Gram negative) and 18:2 omega 6,9c (fungal) were significantly more enriched in delta C-13 in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. These results shows the effectives of PLFA coupled using the pulse chase labeling technique to examine the microbial community changes in response to recently fixed photosynthetic C flow in rhizodeposits.

Urediospores of rust fungi are ice nucleation active at >-10 degrees C and harbor ice nucleation active bacteria	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							PATHOGEN PSEUDOMONAS-SYRINGAE; PHAKOPSORA-PACHYRHIZI; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES; SPORES; SURVIVAL; DEPOSITION; FROST; UREDINIOSPORES; MICROBIOLOGY; UREDOSPORES	Various features of the biology of the rust fungi and of the epidemiology of the plant diseases they cause illustrate the important role of rainfall in their life history. Based on this insight we have characterized the ice nucleation activity (INA) of the aerially disseminated spores (urediospores) of this group of fungi. Urediospores of this obligate plant parasite were collected from natural infections of 7 species of weeds in France, from coffee in Brazil and from field and greenhouse-grown wheat in France, the USA, Turkey and Syria. Immersion freezing was used to determine freezing onset temperatures and the abundance of ice nuclei in suspensions of washed spores. Microbiological analyses of spores from France, the USA and Brazil, and subsequent tests of the ice nucleation activity of the bacteria associated with spores were deployed to quantify the contribution of bacteria to the ice nucleation activity of the spores. All samples of spores were ice nucleation active, having freezing onset temperatures as high as -4 degrees C. Spores in most of the samples carried cells of ice nucleation-active strains of the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae (at rates of less than 1 bacterial cell per 100 urediospores), but bacterial INA accounted for only a small fraction of the INA observed in spore suspensions. Changes in the INA of spore suspensions after treatment with lysozyme suggest that the INA of urediospores involves a polysaccharide. Based on data from the literature, we have estimated the concentrations of urediospores in air at cloud height and in rainfall. These quantities are very similar to those reported for other biological ice nucleators in these same substrates. However, at cloud level convective activity leads to widely varying concentrations of particles of surface origin, so that mean concentrations can underestimate their possible effects on clouds. We propose that spatial and temporal concentrations of biological ice nucleators active at temperatures >-10 degrees C and the specific conditions under which they can influence cloud glaciation need to be further evaluated so as to understand how evolutionary processes couldhave positively selected for INA.

However, disturbances in the system can affect mycorrhizal colonization, metabolic quotient, microbial respiration, and the number and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMP). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nicosulfuron spraying and the seeding density of Urochloa brizantha on soil microbiological attributes. The treatments were arranged in a 2 x 4 factorial design in randomized blocks. The first factor was nicosulfuron doses (0 and 1/5 of the recommended), and the second factor was the forage seeding densities (0, 2, 4 and 6 kg of seeds per hectare). Soil samples were collected 60 days after the emergence of corn plants. The respiratory rate, carbon associated with microbial biomass, metabolic quotient, diversity and number of mycorrhizal fungi spores and mycorrhizal colonization were determined in the soil samples. The seeding density of U. brizantha interfered with microbial respiration, metabolic quotient, mycorrhizal colonization and the population of AMFs. A planting density of 8 kg ha(-1) associated with the application of nicosulfuron resulted in a lower metabolic quotient. The increase in forage seeding density linearly reduced corn yield when sub-doses of nicosulfuron were not applied. Management of the spatial distribution of plants and control of initial forage growth by spraying nicosulfuron provide economic and environmental sustainability to the production system.

A randomized block design was adopted with four replications per treatment (cultivar). By harvest time, 81 days after plants emergence, all tested cultivars (Celeste, Surubi, Campo Grande, Mandi, Lambari, and Taquari) had excellent nodulation ranging from 545 to 760 mg/plant of nodule mass (dry weight). The cultivars Celeste and Taquari, which yielded 8.33 and 7.12 t ha(-1) of dry biomass, respectively, showed other advantageous agronomic characteristics such as: short cycle, a high accumulation of nutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) in green tissues, and good seed setting. These traits indicated potential of 'Celeste' and 'Taquari' to be used as green manure summer crops in organic agriculture systems. Five of the cultivars revealed a tendency for lodging, however within acceptable levels, Cultivars Celeste, Surubi, Campo Grande, Mandi, and Taquari exceeded in 23%, 32%, 33%, 44%, and 70%, respectively, the Brazilian soybean grain yield average of 2,398 kg ha(-1) of the last three years.

Sprays applied prior to flowering did not contribute substantially to overall disease suppression irrespective of disease intensity at the time of spraying. Two field trials conducted in 1991 revealed that when disease was present in a field a spraying program initiated on flowering was preferable to one initiated according to the current action threshold (i.e., when an average of one lesion per 10-m row of plants was detected on true leaves), because it required fewer applications. Reduction in the number of applications did not affect control efficiency or decrease yield. Accordingly, the following guidelines are proposed: fungicides should not be applied prior to flowering, irrespective of disease intensity. Starting at the time of flowering, the crop should be inspected periodically and sprayed when disease is present in the field as determined by the action threshold level. By following these guidelines, growers can expect to achieve a saving of one to three spray applications with no substantial increase in disease development.

JUSS.; SEED-GERMINATION; DROPLET-VITRIFICATION; BRAZILIAN CERRADO; WATER-UPTAKE; PLANT; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; ACCESSIONS; PROTOCOL	Byrsonima intermedia is a shrub from the Brazilian Cerrado with medicinal properties. The storage of biological material at ultra-low temperatures (-196 degrees C) is termed cryopreservation and represents a promising technique for preserving plant diversity. Thawing is a crucial step that follows cryopreservation. The aim of this work was to cryopreserve B. intermedia zygotic embryos and subsequently thaw them at room temperature in a solution rich in sucrose. The embryos were decontaminated and desiccated in a laminar airflow hood for 0-4 hours prior to plunging into liquid nitrogen. The embryo moisture content (% MC) during dehydration was assessed. Cryopreserved embryos were thawed in a solution rich in sucrose at room temperature, inoculated in a germination medium and maintained in a growth chamber. After 30 days, the embryo germination was evaluated. No significant differences were observed between the different embryo dehydration times, where they were dehydrated for at least one hour. Embryos with a MC between 34.3 and 20.3% were germinated after cryopreservation. In the absence of dehydration, all embryos died following cryopreservation. We conclude that B. intermedia zygotic embryos can be successfully cryopreserved and thawed at room temperature after at least one hour of dehydration in a laminar airflow bench.

Therefore, we partitioned soil respiration (SR) into microbial (MR) and root-rhizosphere respiration (RR) using small root exclusion treatments in a mixed mountain forest in Switzerland. In addition, fine root respiration (FRR) was determined with measurements of excised roots. RR and FRR were strongly related to each other (R-2 = 0.92, n = 7), with RR contributing about 46% and FRR about 32% to total SR. RR rates increased more strongly with temperature (Q(10) = 3.2) than MR rates (Q(10) = 2.3). Since the contribution of RR to SR was found to be higher during growing (50%) than during dormant periods (40%), we separated the 2-year data set into phenophases. During the growing period of 2007, the temperature sensitivity of RR (Q(10) = 2.51, R-2 = 0.62) was similar to that of MR (Q(10) = 2.2, R-2 = 0.57). However, during the dormant period of 2006/2007, RR was not related to soil temperature (R-2 = 0.44, n.s.), in contrast to MR (Q(10) = 7.2; R-2 = 0.92). To better understand the influence of plant activity on root respiration, we related RR and FRR rates to photosynthetic active radiation (both R-2 = 0.67, n = 7, P = 0.025), suggesting increased root respiration rates duting times with high photosynthesis. During foliage green-up in spring 2008, i.e.. from bud break to full leaf expansion, RR increased by a factor of 5. while soil temperature increased only by about 5 degrees C, leading to an extraordinary high Q(10) of 10.6; rneanwhile, the contribution of RR to SR increased from 29 to 47%. This clearly shows that root respiration and its apparcut temperature sensitivity highly depend on plant plienology and thus on canopy assimilation and carbon allocation belowground.

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to heat tolerance and early morning flowering (EMF) were analyzed by selective genotyping of phenotypic extremes in 235 BC1F1 plants derived from the cross PSB-Rc82/PSB-Rc82/WAB56-125 under controlled high temperature and 684 BC1F2 plants under glasshouse conditions using single marker analysis (SMA). For heat tolerance, data of pollen fertility and spikelet fertility of BC1F1 plants under high temperature were gathered and analyzed. For EMF, four parameters of flower opening to closing were determined, namely: time when flowers start to open (FOT), time of peak flowering (PFT), time when most of the flowers are closed (FMCT), and time when all of the flowers are closed (FCT). SMA revealed three markers on chromosomes 2, 3, and 8 are possibly linked to pollen fertility, while two markers on chromosomes 7 and 8 are possibly linked to spikelet fertility under high temperature. SMA for EMF revealed three markers on chromosomes 5, 7, and 9 are possibly linked to FOT, while six markers on chromosomes 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11 are possibly linked to PFT, FMCT and FCT. In general, markers on chromosomes 7 and 8 could be linked to QTLs controlling both heat tolerance and EMF at flowering stage in rice. The results could be useful for further fine mapping and marker-aided selection for heat-tolerant and heat escape in rice genotypes in the future.

Evaluation of Winter Squash and Pumpkin Cultivars for Age-related Resistance to Phytophthora capsici Fruit Rot	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article						ontogenetic; pepo; oomycete; Cucurbita	ROOT-ROT; ONTOGENIC RESISTANCE; CULTURAL-PRACTICES; CUCUMBER FRUIT; SUMMER SQUASH; GRAPE BERRIES; DAMPING-OFF; CROWN ROT; INFECTION; WATERMELON	Phytophthora capsici annually threatens production of cucurbit and solanaceous crops. Long-lived oospores produced by the pathogen incite primary infection of susceptible plants when conditions are wet. Limiting the rot of winter squash and pumpkin (Cucurbita sp.) fruits is difficult due to the long maturation period when fruits are often in direct contact with infested soil. Genetic resistance to fruit rot is not widely available within Cucurbita sp.; however, age-related resistance (ARR) to P. capsici fruit rot develops in specific cultivars during maturation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the fruits of 12 cultivars of Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita moschata, and Cucurbita maxima for ARR to P. capsici using a mycelial-plug inoculation method. All Cucurbita pepo and Cucurbita moschata cultivars displayed ARR; 7 days postpollination (dpp) fruits were susceptible, limited lesion development occurred on fruits 22 dpp, and lesions did not develop at 56 dpp. Disease developed on both Cucurbita maxima cultivars tested at 7, 14, 22, and 56 dpp. Firmness of fruit exocarps was measured with a manual penetrometer. Exocarp firmness of all cultivars increased during maturation; however, there was no correlation between firmness and disease incidence among cultivars at 22 dpp (R-2 = -0.01, P = 0.85). When fruits of cultivars expressing ARR at 22 dpp were wounded before inoculation, fruit rot developed.

All the cultivars were earlier in germination and days to 50% flowering, and shorter in duration in pre-rainy (kharif) season in comparison to winter (rabi) season. The pre-kharif season was more suitable in terms of nodulation, growth, yield-attributing characters and yield of all the cultivars of groundnut than rabi season. Among the cultivars, 'ICGV 95111' performed better with respect to different growth-attributing characters and gave the highest yield which was 21.8 and 23.7% higher over the local check 'Gangapuri' in rabi and pre-kharif season, respectively. The overall performance of local strain of Rhizobium was significantly better than the foreign strain in pre- kharif season as well as in rabi season and was superior in nodule formation and pod yield of groundnut. Correlation analysis as well as the multivariate step-wise regression analysis of crop growth rate (CGR), number and weight of nodules/plant with different abiotic factors in both the seasons showed that pre-kharif was more conducive than rabi season for groundnut cultivation in tend agro-climatic region of West Bengal.

In Arabidopsis, cryptochrome 2 (cry2) is involved primarily in the control of flowering time and in photomorphogenesis under low-fluence light. No data on the function of cry2 are available in plants, apart from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Expression of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) CRY2 gene was altered through a combination of transgenic overexpression and virus-induced gene silencing. Tomato CRY2 overexpressors show phenotypes similar to but distinct from their Arabidopsis counterparts (hypocotyl and internode shortening under both low- and high-fluence blue light), but also several novel ones, including a high-pigment phenotype, resulting in overproduction of anthocyanins and chlorophyll in leaves and of flavonoids and lycopene in fruits. The accumulation of lycopene in fruits is accompanied by the decreased expression of lycopene beta-cyclase genes. CRY2 overexpression causes an unexpected delay in flowering, observed under both short- and long-day conditions, and an increased outgrowth of axillary branches. Virus-induced gene silencing of CRY2 results in a reversion of leaf anthocyanin accumulation, of internode shortening, and of late flowering in CRY2-overexpressing plants, whereas in wild-type plants it causes a minor internode elongation.

Plants were inoculated in the field by injecting a spore suspension into the silk channel of individual ears. Disease severity and deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration in grain were determined at harvest. In three experiments, plants were inoculated with 1) six conidial suspension volumes ranging from 0.5 to 10 ml in 1991 and 1992; 2) seven spore concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 X 10(6) spores per milliliter in 1990, 1991, and 1992; and 3) three spore concentrations (2 X 10(5), 5 X 10(5), and 2 X 10(6) spores per milliliter) inoculated at six silk ages (1, 3, 5, 7, 12, and 18 days after silk emergence) in 1991 and 1992. On average, Pride K127 was most resistant, followed by Pioneer 3953 and Dekalb DK-415. Disease severity, and in most cases DON, increased with increased conidial suspension volume and concentration, with greater effects in susceptible hybrids. Disease severity decreased with silk age over all spore concentrations. When screening for resistance to infection via the silk, 2 mi of a 5 X 10(5) spores per milliliter suspension injected into the silk channel at approximately 6 days after silk emergence should give adequate differentiation of genotypes.

Studies on the direct interaction between plants and mycorrhizal fungi are numerous whereas studies on the indirect interaction between such fungi and herbivores feeding on aboveground plant parts are scarce. We studied the impact of AM symbiosis on host plant choice and life history of an acarine surface piercing-sucking herbivore, the polyphagous two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Experiments were performed on detached leaflets taken from common bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) colonized or not colonized by the AM fungus Glomus mosseae. T. urticae females were subjected to choice tests between leaves from mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. Juvenile survival and development, adult female survival, oviposition rate and offspring sex ratio were measured in order to estimate the population growth parameters of T. urticae on either substrate. Moreover, we analyzed the macro- and micronutrient concentration of the aboveground plant parts. Adult T. urticae females preferentially resided and oviposited on mycorrhizal versus non-mycorrhizal leaflets. AM symbiosis significantly decreased embryonic development time and increased the overall oviposition rate as well as the proportion of female offspring produced during peak oviposition. Altogether, the improved life history parameters resulted in significant changes in net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase, doubling time and finite rate of increase. Aboveground parts of colonized plants showed higher concentrations of P and K whereas Mn and Zn were both found at lower levels. This is the first study documenting the effect of AM symbiosis on the population growth rates of a herbivore, tracking the changes in life history characteristics throughout the life cycle. We discuss the AM-plant-herbivore interaction in relation to plant quality, herbivore feeding type and site and the evolutionary implications in a multi-trophic context.

In Mexico Zea mays (maize) is a crop which demands nitrogen fertilizer (NIFE) as a NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate), in that sense hiperfertilization causes soil's lost productivity. An alternative of solution to solve this problem is the reduction and the optimization of NIFE with inoculants based on genus and species of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB). The aim of this study was to analyze the growth of Z. mays inoculated with Bacillus cereus and Micromonospora echinospora at 50% reduced NIFE. An experimental design of randomized blocks was used with (NH4NO3) as NIFE at the dose 50% (5 g/L) for Z. mays inoculated with the PGPB: the response variables on its seed: germination percent, day to germination, its shoot and root phenology: height plant, number of leaves, and root long and biomass: aerial fresh weight, root fresh weight, aerial dry weight, root dry weight (AFW/RFW/ADW/RDW). Experimental data were analyzed by ANOVA and minimal significant difference (LSD). Results showed a positive effect of B. cereus and M. echinospora on Z. mays seed as well as at seeding and flowering stages, where Z. mays had a RWD of 3.5 g, numerical value statistically different compared with 1.1 g of RDW of Z. mays fed with NIFE at 100% dose, not inoculated used as a relative control (RC) Those data suggested that the inoculation of Z. mays with B. cereus and M. echinospora improving radical absorption of NIFE reduce at 50%, due to PGBP were able to transform seed and root organic exudates into growth promoting vegetal compounds (GPVC) or phytohormons avoiding soil's lost productivity.

L., Fernandez, M. R. and DePauw, R. M. 2003. Red smudge infection modifies sprouting response in four wheat lines. Can. J. Plant Sci. 83: 163-169. Infection of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) spikes by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs. (Ptr) causes kernel discolouration, reducing the commercial value of the grain. Preharvest sprouting in wheat causes loss of grain yield, grain functionality and value as seed. The objective of this research was to determine the effects of Ptr infection on the expression of preharvest sprouting response. Four genotypes representing a range of preharvest sprouting response were studied: RL4137 has very good sprouting resistance; SC8021V2, good; AC Karma, fair; and Genesis, poor. These genotypes were grown in a growth cabinet and their spikes were artificially inoculated with a conidial suspension of Ptr or water. Spikes were collected at physiologic maturity, threshed by hand and germinated on wetted filter paper at 10 or 20degreesC to obtain a percentage germination and a mean germination time. Healthy seeds were also germinated in a solution containing a crude extract of the fungus. At 20degreesC, sprouting-resistant genotypes showed a significant delay in germination compared to susceptible genotypes; however, differences were not significant at the lower temperature. Genesis germinated quickly at both temperatures. All genotypes except Genesis had reductions in sprouting resistance when infected by Ptr, but these effects were significant only at 20degreesC. When inoculated with,Ptr and germinated at 20degreesC, AC Karma germinated as quickly as the water controls and gave a preharvest sprouting response similar to Genesis. However, SC8021V2 and RL4137 inoculated with Ptr retained 40 and 78%, respectively, of their mean germination time compared to the water controls. Germination of healthy seeds in a solution containing a crude extract of Ptr increased the percentage germination and shortened the mean germination time of all genotypes, but did not result in significant changes for any individual line.

The biological control agent Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713 (Rhapsody, containing 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units per g) was evaluated for efficacy against four major diseases affecting greenhouse cucumbers grown in British Columbia, Canada. These diseases included powdery mildew, Fusarium root and stem rot, Pythium crown and root rot, and gummy stem blight. Rhapsody was applied as a root drench or spray to leaves or flowers at a rate of 1.0 L product/100 L water, or in some experiments at 1.5 L product/100 L water. Applications were made 1 and 4 days prior to, as well as after, pathogen inoculation. Weekly foliar applications of Rhapsody significantly (P <= 0.05) reduced powdery mildew colony development and showed eradicative effects on established leaf infections. Leaf area infected on untreated plants was 80-100% compared to 15-20% on Rhapsody-treated plants. Two drenches of Rhapsody made 1 and 4 days prior to Fusarium inoculation significantly (P <= 0.05) improved plant growth (height and dry weight) after five weeks, but growth was lower compared to the noninoculated control plants. Treatments made 1 and 4 days post-inoculation were much less effective in preventing disease development. Application of Rhapsody to Pythium-inoculated plants, prior to or after inoculation, did not significantly increase plant height or dry weight compared to the pathogen-only treatment. Developing cucumber fruit inoculated with a mycelial suspension of the gummy stem blight pathogen caused 24-30% post-harvest decay after fruit were incubated at 20-22 degrees C for 7-10 days. Fruit infection was reduced by almost 55% when Rhapsody was applied 24 h prior to pathogen inoculation while an application made 24 h after pathogen inoculation had no effect. Preventative applications of Rhapsody were effective in reducing development of powdery mildew, Fusarium root and stem rot, and gummy stem blight on cucumber, while eradicative applications were effective against powdery mildew only. There was no effect observed against Pythium root rot.

In this study, the pattern of virus accumulation over the plant lifespan has been examined in systemically invaded tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana infected by either of two distinct (+)RNA viruses: Turnip mosaic virus, a member of Potyvirus, and Oilseed rape,mosaic virus, a member of Tobamovirus. Quantitative analyses of virus coat protein and virus genomic RNA in roots versus aerial plant parts revealed generally sinusoidal temporal patterns of virus accumulation. In noninoculated leaves, a time period was found during which no virus accumulation was detected. This period was coincident with the approximately 7 days of inflorescence bud formation and differentiation. In roots, virion content reached high levels a few days after inoculation, dropping dramatically during the period of bud formation and quickly recovering after it. These results, together with electron microscopy observations, are consistent with loss of virions due to disassembly. Fluorescence observations of green fluorescent protein-tagged virus-infected root tissue also were consistent with a net loss of virus-specified proteins. Inoculations performed after the emergence of the inflorescence and on A. thaliana flowering-time mutants support the temporal link between observed changes in virus content and inflorescence bud formation. Different host-involving biochemical processes can be invoked to provide mechanistic clues, but no one of them alone seems sufficient to explain the complex patterns of tight temporal regulation of virus accumulation observed in these experiments.

The life-history components recorded were oviposition late, adult survival, pre-adult survival, developmental period, and sex ratio. The simulation model serves as a tool to combine these components and to obtain a single criterion for (antibiotic) resistance. The criterion used was the decrease in simulated intrinsic population growth rate, r(s), relative the r(s) value determined on a susceptible control genotype. This model-based evaluation method was tested using the greenhouse whitefly. Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood, on tomato and the sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius, on tomato, eggplant, collard, and pepper. To study its consistency over time, the evaluation method was repeated six times for T. vaporariorum on a susceptible and a resistant tomato cultivar. Simulated intrinsic population growth rate was more consistent in indicating resistance than any of the individual life-history components. Of ten L. hirsutum accessions tested for resistance to T. vaporariorum, three exhibited r(s) values that were significantly lower than those for the susceptible control. In addition, on these ten L. hirsutum accessions, a significant positive correlation was observed between r(s) and sex ratio (# females/# males). Four host plant species (tomato, collard, eggplant, and pepper) were evaluated for resistance to B. tabaci. All life-history components and r(s) values varied among host species, while a negative r(s) value was observed for B. tabaci on pepper. A high correlation was found between results from a sensitivity analysis of SARAH and results from a sensitivity analysis of a validated whitefly population simulation model by Yano et al. (1989a). Significant correlations were found for the relationships between oviposition rate, adult survival, or pre-adult survival and r(s), indicating that none of these life-history components can be omitted from the test procedure. This model-based evaluation method offers a standardized way to quantify levels of antibiotic resistance to whiteflies and will enhance efficiency in breeding programs.

Inoculated treatments and inoculated treatments plus 15 kg N.ha(-1), absolute control, and 60 kg N.ha(-1) (15 kg N.ha(-1) at sowing and 45 kg N.ha(-1) at tillering) were distributed in blocks at random with four replications. Dry matter and total N accumulation, as well as grain production, were evaluated 20 days after anthesis and at maturity. Straw biomass variation between both evaluations was positive for all inoculated treatments, while such variation was negative in the non-inoculated treatments, indicating straw biomass accumulation instead of loss in the treatments with inoculation. Inoculation promoted a greater absorption of N at post-anthesis stage period, in which a higher availability of N did not contribute to an increase in grain production. Powder peat inoculant of strain JA04, plus 15 kgN.ha(-1) at sowing, replaced nitrogen fertilization of 45 kg N.ha(-1), applied as topdressing, without any negative effect on yield.

The unnecessary use of fungicides in extended areas increases production costs, risk of resistance and risk of negative environmental impact. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a scoring system to guide the application of fungicides in soybean crops to manage LSDs in Argentina, with special reference to Septoria brown spot and Cercospora leaf blight. To develop the scoring system, a risk matrix with weighted epidemiological risk factors was developed based on previous research data. The scoring system recommends application of foliar fungicides based on the total points accumulated from the risk factors. Scoring greater than 33 indicates a higher probability of obtaining a positive yield response, whereas scoring below 23 indicates no expected response and thus no need for fungicide applications. Intermediate values indicate that the application of fungicides would produce uncertain results thus detailed analysis of risk factors would be required. To validate the scoring system, 19 field trials were carried out over five growing seasons in three Argentinian provinces. The fungicide used in all trials was a mixture of a quinone outside inhibitor and a demethylation inhibitor fungicide. In most cases, the scoring system resulted in appropriate decisions to apply the fungicide within the so-called window of opportunity, which lies between the R3 and R5 soybean developmental stages. The greatest yield responses were achieved when the scoring system recommended the fungicide application at R3 or R4 or R5, depending on the obtained sum of points. In all cases, except when the scoring system recommended no application of the fungicide, disease severity values were significantly greater in untreated than in treated plants. Regarding net income, phenology-based applications showed negative margins in cases where the scoring system recommended no applications, demonstrating that in such situations the use of fungicide caused losses rather than yield advantages. In contrast, when the scoring system recommended the application of fungicide regardless of timing (R3, R4 or R5), net margins were always positive and generally provided a higher income. The scoring system presented in this study can be a valuable tool to reduce the number of fungicide applications in soybean crops, especially in seasons when conditions for LSD development are not favorable.

Here, we examined the interactions between plant sex and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal species affecting the reproductive output of Geranium sylvaticum, a sexually polymorphic plant species with frequent intermediate sexes between females and hermaphrodites, using a common garden experiment. Flowering phenology, AM colonisation levels and several plant vegetative and reproductive parameters, including seed and pollen production, were measured. Differences among sexes were detected in flowering, fruit set, pollen production and floral size. The two AM species used in the present work had different effects on plant fitness parameters. One AM species increased female fitness through increasing seed number and seed mass, while the other species reduced seed mass in all sexes investigated. AM fungi did not affect intermediate and hermaphrodite pollen content in anthers. The three sexes in G.sylvaticum did not differ in their reproductive output in terms of total seed production, but hermaphrodites had potentially larger fathering ability than intermediates due to higher anther number. The ultimate female function - seed production - did not differ among the sexes, but one of the AM fungi used potentially decreased host plant fitness. In addition, in the intermediate sex, mycorrhizal symbiosis functioned similarly in females as in hermaphrodites.

In the present study, we assessed the impact of palm date consumption, rich in both polyphenols and fibre, on the growth of colonic microbiota and markers of colon cancer risk in a randomised, controlled, cross-over human intervention study. A total of twenty-two healthy human volunteers were randomly assigned to either a control group (maltodextrin-dextrose, 37.1 g) or an intervention group (seven dates, approximately 50 g). Each arm was of 21 d duration and was separated by a 14-d washout period in a cross-over manner. Changes in the growth of microbiota were assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis, whereas SCFA levels were assessed using HPLC. Further, ammonia concentrations, faecal water genotoxicity and anti-proliferation ability were also assessed using different assays, which included cell work and the Comet assay. Accordingly, dietary intakes, anthropometric measurements and bowel movement assessment were also carried out. Although the consumption of dates did not induce significant changes in the growth of select bacterial groups or SCFA, there were significant increases in bowel movements and stool frequency (P < 0.01; n 21) and significant reductions in stool ammonia concentration (P < 0.05; n 21) after consumption of dates, relative to baseline. Furthermore, date fruit intake significantly reduced genotoxicity in human faecal water relative to control (P < 0.01; n 21). Our data indicate that consumption of date fruit may reduce colon cancer risk without inducing changes in the microbiota.

J	702		Graham, JH; Abbott, LK				Graham, JH; Abbott, LK			Wheat responses to aggressive and non-aggressive arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						carbon costs; host-fungus compatibility; parasitism; plant growth depression; root colonization; soil phosphorus supply	PHOSPHORUS-NUTRITION; NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS; EXTERNAL HYPHAE; COLONIZATION; DEPENDENCE; GROWTH; CITRUS; ROOTS; YIELD; INFECTION	In southwestern Australia fields, colonization of wheat roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is reduced due to repeated use of phosphate (P) fertilizers. We predicted AMF that aggressively colonize wheat roots at low P supply would also aggressively colonize at high P supply, but provide no additional P uptake benefit and reduce growth. Wheat (cv. Kulin) seedlings were non-mycorrhizal (NM) or inoculated separately with 10 isolates of AMF from wheat-belt soils in a glasshouse experiment. Kojonup loamy sand was supplied with P to provide suboptimal and supraoptimal P for growth of NM wheat in this soil. At low P supply, wheat growth was limited by P availability. All AMF isolates colonized wheat roots at 14 days after emergence of seedlings. At 42 days, percentage root length colonized (%RLC) was highest for two isolates of Scutellospora calospora, WUM 12(2) and WUM 12(3), followed by Glomus sp. WUM 51, G. invermaium WUM 10(1), Acaulospora laevis WUM 11(4) and Gigaspora decipiens WUM 6(1). These isolates, designated as 'aggressive colonizers', ranged from 50 to 89%RLC. A second group of AMF ranged from 1 to 19%RLC at 42 days. This group, termed 'non-aggressive colonizers', included Acaulospora spp. WUM 11(1), WUM 46, and WUM 49 and Glomus sp. WUM 44. High soil P supply increased seedling growth 2-3 fold, but reduced%RLC. Grouping of aggressive and non-aggressive AMF based on colonization rate at high P supply was similar to that at low P. At low P supply, only the two isolates of S. calospora increased wheat growth compared to the NM plant. The remaining aggressive and non-aggressive AMF reduced growth of wheat at low P, while aggressive colonizers reduced growth at high P. At low P supply, the aggressive colonizers increased shoot P concentration, while at high P, shoot P was not affected by AMF. Growth depression by aggressive colonizers was associated with reduced sucrose concentration in roots. Based on the negative growth response under low and high P fertility in the glasshouse, AMF could be expected to produce non-beneficial effects on wheat in the field depending on the P status of the soil and the aggressiveness of AMF in the community.

To examine this assumption, 3-, 4-, and 5-week-old wheat plants were inoculated with equal quantities of urediniospores of Puccinia struformis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat stripe rust (WSR). Disease severity on each leaf was assessed and fit by mixed-effect linear model as a function of leaf position and plant age. Younger plants had significantly greater disease severity than older plants, with mean severities of 50.4, 30.1, and 12.9% on plants that were 3, 4, and 5 weeks old, respectively, at time of inoculation. This effect was greater on leaves higher on the plant. Within same-aged plants, younger leaves had significantly greater disease severity than older leaves, with mean severities of 40.2, 34.8, and 17.7% on the uppermost, second, and third leaf, respectively. These results suggest that the vertical distribution of WSR lesions in agricultural fields could be driven by differences in host susceptibility more so than propagule dispersal.	[Farber, D.

J	704		Andersen, RA				Andersen, RA			What to do with Protists?	AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Commemorative Conference on Beyond the Floras	1996	UNIV MELBOURNE, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA		UNIV MELBOURNE		RIBOSOMAL-RNA SEQUENCES; EQUATORIAL PACIFIC-OCEAN; RHODYMENIALES RHODOPHYTA; IRON FERTILIZATION; RBCL SEQUENCES; GENE-SEQUENCES; MOLECULAR-DATA; CLASSIS NOV; ORD NOV; PHYLOGENY	The definition of 'protists' has changed over time, once including all living organisms which were neither plant nor animal, now including a multitude of organisms that cannot be assembled into a monophyletic group. Protists were once subdivided into algae, fungi and protozoa, based upon mode of nutrition, and further subdivided based upon the dominate life history stage (e.g. flagellate, amoeboid, coccoid), however, studies during the past 40 years have shown that these divisions are artificial. Electron microscopic studies, as well as a revival of the Endosymbiotic Theory for the origin of organelles, have caused a demolition of classical protistan taxonomy. Numerous new higher level taxa were described. Molecular studies, especially nucleotide sequence comparisons, have provided a new means for determining phylogenetic relationships. Although these molecular studies have not succeeded in providing an overall consensus classification for the protists, many advances have been made. It now appears that the protists are, at best, a grade, not a clade, and they do not form a monophyletic taxon (i.e. the Kingdom Protista cannot be recognised as a natural group). Despite this taxonomic limitation, there are advantages to maintaining the protists as an assemblage for ecological, biomedical or economic reasons. The biodiversity of protists is discussed along with remarks on their ecological and economic significance.

The process depends on a large number of factors (biological, chemical, and physical) among which microbial populations play a fundamental role. The high temperatures that occur during the composting process indicate the presence of thermotolerant and thermophilic micro-organisms that are key for the optimization of the process. However, the same micro-organisms can be harmful (allergenic, pathogenic) for workers that handle large quantities of material in the plant, and for end users, for example, in the indoor environment (e.g., pots in houses and offices). Accurate knowledge of thermotolerant and thermophilic organisms present during the composting stages is required to find key organisms to improve the process and estimate potential health risks. The objective of the present work was to study thermotolerant and thermophilic mycobiota at different time points of compost maturation. Fungi were isolated at four temperatures (25, 37, 45, and 50 degrees C) from compost samples collected at five different steps during a 21-day compost-maturation period in an active composting plant in Liguria (northwestern Italy). The samples were subsequently plated on three different media. Our results showed a high presence of fungi with an order of magnitude ranging from 1 x 10(4)to 3 x 10(5)colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1). The isolated strains, identified by means of specific molecular tools (ITS, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, elongation factor 1-alpha, and LSU sequencing), belonged to 45 different species. Several thermophilic species belonging to generaThermoascusandThermomyceswere detected, which could be key during composting. Moreover, the presence of several potentially harmful fungal species, such asAspergillus fumigatus,A. terreus,andScedosporium apiospermum,were found during the whole process, including the final product. Results highlighted the importance of surveying the mycobiota involved in the composting process in order to: (i) find solutions to improve efficiency and (ii) reduce health risks.

In spite of this, caterpillars with highly diverse life histories appear to lack resident microbiota. Gut physiology, endogenous digestive enzymes, and limited social interactions may contribute to this pattern, but the consequences of shifts in social activity and diet on caterpillar microbiota are largely unknown. Phengaris alcon caterpillars undergo particularly dramatic social and dietary shifts when they parasitize Myrmica ant colonies, rapidly transitioning from solitary herbivory to ant tending (i.e., receiving protein-rich regurgitations through trophallaxis). This unique life history provides a model for studying interactions between social living, diet, and caterpillar microbiota. Here, we characterized and compared bacterial communities within P.alcon caterpillars before and after their association with ants, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR. After being adopted by ants, bacterial communities within P.alcon caterpillars shifted substantially, with a significant increase in alpha diversity and greater consistency in bacterial community composition in terms of beta dissimilarity. We also characterized the bacterial communities within their host ants (Myrmica schencki), food plant (Gentiana cruciata), and soil from ant nest chambers. These data indicated that the aforementioned patterns were influenced by bacteria derived from caterpillars' surrounding environments, rather than through transfers from ants. Thus, while bacterial communities are substantially reorganized over the life cycle of P.alcon caterpillars, it appears that they do not rely on transfers of bacteria from host ants to complete their development.

Response of soil microbial activity to grazing, nitrogen deposition, and exotic cover in a serpentine grassland	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						California; Cattle; Extracellular enzyme activity; Fertilization; Festuca perennis; Invasive species	EXTRACELLULAR ENZYME-ACTIVITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PLANT INVASION; N DEPOSITION; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; ELEVATED CO2; LITTER; DECOMPOSITION; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM	Exotic species, nitrogen (N) deposition, and grazing are major drivers of change in grasslands. However little is known about the interactive effects of these factors on below-ground microbial communities. We simulated realistic N deposition increases with low-level fertilization and manipulated grazing with fencing in a split-plot experiment in California's largest serpentine grassland. We also monitored grazing intensity using camera traps and measured total available N to assess grazing and nutrient enrichment effects on microbial extracellular enzyme activity (EEA), microbial N mineralization, and respiration rates in soil. Continuous measures of grazing intensity and N availability showed that increased grazing and N were correlated with increased microbial activity and were stronger predictors than the categorical grazing and fertilization measures. Exotic cover was also generally correlated with increased microbial activity resulting from exotic-driven nutrient cycling alterations. Seasonal effects, on abiotic factors and plant phenology, were also an important factor in EEA with lower activity occurring at peak plant biomass. In combination with previous studies from this serpentine grassland, our results suggest that grazing intensity and soil N availability may affect the soil microbial community indirectly via effects on exotic cover and associated changes in nutrient cycling while grazing directly impacts soil community function.

Marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) is one of the farmer's first choice for commercial cultivation. It is commonly propagated through seeds, but some ornamentally high valued petaloid and gynomonoecious lines can only be maintained through vegetative propagation. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation was to develop efficient in vitro protocol for mass multiplication of commercially high valued petaloid male sterile cultivars. Nodal segments were chosen as explant from two thermotolerant marigold cultivars, viz. Siracole Orange and Siracole Yellow. Explants were pre-treated with carbendazim (0.2%) + metalaxyl (0.2%) + 8-hydroxy quinoline citrate (200 mg/l) for 60 min followed by surface sterilization with 0.1% HgCl2 for 4 min to eliminate the microbial contamination. Highest culture establishment (82.2%) and earliest bud emergence (3.88 days) was recorded in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with BAP (0.5 mg/l) and NAA (0.05 mg/l). Maximum (6, 28, 122 and 404 shoots/explant) proliferation with healthy shoots and free from callus was obtained on MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l BAP + 0.1 mg/l NAA + 2.5 mg/l AgNO3 in 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after culture respectively. Maximum elongation (2.10 cm) was observed on MS media devoid of growth regulators (control). Highest rooting percentage (96.50%), maximum number of roots (23.37), rapid root induction (5.25 days) and high ex vitro survival (91.25%) was noted in 1/2 MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/l IBA. Highest plant survival (98.10%) and superior plant growth was observed when rooted plants were shifted to low-cost polypropylene glasses instead of traditional glass bottle system. This protocol is highly useful for mass multiplication of true-to-type, disease free planting material as well as helpful in long term maintenance of germplasm lines.	[Kumar, K.

B153-2-2 populations were established soon after introduction into the soil; a significantly greater population density (6 cfu/g of soil) was observed at 2 or 3 wk than at 1 or 4 wk after emergence in a root zone containing a taproot, its main branches, and adjacent soil. B153-2-2 populations increased after introduction, remained constant during the growing season, and then decreased toward the end of the year at a 10-cm depth in the root zone of a soil cylinder 0-10 cm out from the stem and 30 cm deep. Populations of the bacterium at 20- and 30-cm depths remained relatively constant throughout the season. Residual populations of B153-2-2 survived the winter at no less than 4 log cfu/g of soil and were recoverable during the second growing season without further introduction of the bacterium. Introduced bacterial populations in the rhizosphere and root zones were dispersed further vertically than horizontally from the application site and were recoverable to at least 50 cm deep and 30 cm laterally from a taproot 39 days after seedling emergence. B153-2-2 populations reached 6 log cfu/g of soil with minimum recovery of 2 log cfu/g of soil in the extended rhizosphere and root zones. The compatibility with indigenous soil microflora, the close association with soybeans, and the ability to colonize soybean roots and rhizosphere make B. megaterium B153-2-2 a potential candidate for management of microflora in the rhizosphere.

However, planting into cold soils in spring results in slow germination, which may predispose seedlings to infection by soil-borne pathogens. In a controlled-environment study of the impact of temperature on infection of lentil seedlings (cv. Eston) by Fusarium avenaceum, root rot symptoms were most severe at warm temperatures (20 degrees to 27.5 degreesC) and declined in warmer or cooler soils. Field plots were seeded on three dates, which were spaced about 2 wk apart between early May and early June in four station years. Seedling emergence was most consistent and seed yield was highest in three of four sites at the second seeding date. Emergence and yield were substantially lower for the latest seeding date. Inoculation with F. avenaceum reduced establishment and seed yield. Seed treatment with Crown (thiabendazole and carbathiin) improved seedling survival, reduced root rot severity and increased seed yield relative to the inoculated control. Vitaflo-280 (thiram and carbathiin) also improved establishment and yield, but the effect was not as strong or consistent. Treatment with Raxil (tebuconazole) and Apron (metalaxyl) had no effect. The pathogenicity of aggressive isolates of F. avenaceum from lentil on a range of crop species was evaluated. All crops were susceptible to some degree, which indicates that the pathogen, once established, is likely to persist in a field for some time. This study demonstrated that early planting was required for maximum yield, that certain isolates of F, avenaceum were pathogenic on a wide range of hosts, and that seed treatment can be used to minimize losses from seedling blight and root rot in lentil.

Development of efficient regeneration and transformation protocol is very important for recalcitrant plants like cotton. In the present study, five-day-old germinated mature embryo parts especially embryonic axis, hypocotyl and plumule of cotton 'Lashata' were wounded and inoculated with A. tumefaciens strain GV2260 harbouring plasmid p35S-GUS-INT. The binary plasmid p35S-GUS-INT contains neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPTII) gene driven by nopaline synthase (NOS) promoter and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene controlled by cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. After inoculation, explants were co-cultivated in liquid and agar-solidified MS medium for 48 h in dark condition. Agar-solidified co-cultivation medium increased transformation frequency as compared to liquid medium. The putative primary transformants were confirmed with histochemical GUS assay, PCR and RT-PCR. However, comparing the three culture explant, the embryonic axis explants had significant difference with embryonic hypocotyl and plumule explants in terms of number and percentage (%) of GUS, PCR and RT-PCR positive plant. The total transformation efficiency was recorded as 3% with varying GUS expression levels.	[Ahmed, H. A. A.] Usak Univ, Fac Agr & Nat Sci, Dept Field Croups, Usak, Turkey; [Ahmed, H. A.

Previous studies showed that P. indica promotes early flowering and plant growth in the medicinal plant Coleus forskohlii. To determine the impact of P. indica on flowering time in Arabidopsis, we co-cultivated the plants with P. indica under long day condition. P. indica inoculated Arabidopsis plants displayed significant early flowering phenotype. qRT-PCR analysis of colonized plants revealed an up-regulation of flowering regulatory (FLOWERING LOCUST, LEAFY, and APETALA1) and gibberellin biosynthetic (Gibberellin 20-Oxidase2, Gibberellin 3-Oxidase1 and Gibberellin requiring) genes, while, the flowering-repressing gene FLOWERING LOCUS C was down regulated. Quantification of gibberellins content showed that the colonization with P. indica caused an increase in GA(4) content. Compared to wild-type plants, inoculation of the Arabidopsis ga5 mutant affected in gibberellin biosynthetic gene led to less pronounced changes in the expression of genes regulating flowering and to a lower increase in GA(4) content. Taken together, our data indicate that P. indica promotes early flowering in Arabidopsis likely by increasing gibberellin content. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Inoculation of susceptible and resistant potato plants with the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans: effects on an aphid and its parasitoid	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						plant<bold>-</bold>insect interactions; genetic modification; non-target effects; trophic interactions; plant-pathogen-insect interactions; Solanum tuberosum; Myzus persicae; Aphidius colemani; Hemiptera; Aphididae; Hymenoptera; Braconidae	SEX-RATIO; SINGLE; GENES; FIELD; REPRODUCTION; HERBIVORES; QUALITY; PROJECT; CROPS	Plants are exposed to microbial pathogens as well as herbivorous insects and their natural enemies. Here, we examined the effects of inoculation of potato plants, Solanum tuberosum L. (Solanaceae), with the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary (Peronosporales: Pythiaceae) on an aphid species commonly infesting potato crops and one of the aphid's major parasitoids. We observed the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and its natural enemy, the biocontrol agent Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), on potato either inoculated with water or P.infestans. Population growth of the aphid, parasitism rate of its natural enemy, and other insect life-history traits were compared on several potato genotypes, the susceptible cultivar Desiree and genetically modified (GM) isogenic lines carrying genes conferring resistance to P.infestans. Effects of P.infestans inoculation on the intrinsic rate of aphid population increase and the performance of the parasitoid were only found on the susceptible cultivar. Insect traits were similar when comparing inoculated with non-inoculated resistant GM genotypes. We also tested how GM-plant characteristics such as location of gene insertion and number of R genes could influence non-target insects by comparing insect performance among GM events. Different transformation events leading to different positions of R-gene insertion in the genome influenced aphids either with or without P.infestans infection, whereas effects of position of R-gene insertion on the parasitoid A.colemani were evident only in the presence of inoculation with P.infestans. We conclude that it is important to study different transformation events before continuing with further stages of risk assessment of this GM crop. This provides important information on the effects of plant resistance to a phytopathogen on non-target insects at various trophic levels.

R. Br. was carried out to study the phytogenetic peculiarities of the hybrid plants. In order to improve the oil quality of rape seed, ovaries of B. napus pollinated with pollen of M. incana, were cut off and inoculated onto MS media supplemented with various plant hormones at the 7th day after pollination. Two mature embryos were obtained from 750 pollinated ovaries cultured in vitro. The percentage of seed set was 0.26%. The mature embryos were transferred onto the MS media supplemented with 2.0 mg/L 6-BA + 0.1 mg/L NAA, and a compound bud was produced later. The compound bud was then cut into a number of single buds, which were transferred onto fresh media. Twenty-two plantlets in vitro were developed from the above single buds. The hybrid plants (F-1) were basically intermediate between the two parents in many,characters with a few showing hybrid vigor. The fertility of hybrid plants (F-1) was poor. Cytological studies revealed that the hybrid plants (F-1) were mixoploid. in nature. The chromosome number of many somatic cells was 2n = 26, which was the sum of the chromosome number of the two parents. The chromosome number of other somatic cells was 2n = 38, similar to that of B. napus. The hybrid offspring (F-2) from the selfed hybrid plants (F-1) showed polymorphism. Among the hybrid offspring (F-2) some were nearly matroclinous and fertile, similar to B. napus. some others were intermediate between the two parents and less fertile, and a few were poorly developed and nearly infertile. From the hybrid offspring a few plants with improved seed-oil quality were obtained.

At pH 7.0, however, only some of no significant effects were observed in total bacteria isolated from the same soils. Growth of Actinomycetes was slightly increased by thiamine at pH 5.0, but inhibited at pH 7.0 at high concentrations. In most soils tested, total numbers of bacteria, Actinomycetes and fungi (determined as cfu g(-1) soil) were significantly higher in the rhizosphere of 10 d old bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) seedlings after seed treatment with thiamine mononitrate. No significant increases were observed in total Pseudomonas fluorescens isolated from the rhizosphere of vitamin-treated plants. In seed and root exudates of bean seedlings about 12 % of the original seed content of thiamine (0.9 mu g seed(-1)) were released after 5 days of germination. Thiamine applied to bean seeds (3 mM in the imbibition solution) was taken up rapidly and in high amounts. Subsequently, 83 % of this amount was released from the thiamine-treated seedlings during the 12 days of growth. Within the first 5 days of germination, the treated seeds released about thousand times more thiamine into the rhizosphere compared to untreated seeds. The results suggest that a large proportion of the thiamine applied as seed dressing was released from the developing bean seedlings and has contributed to the thiamine supply of rhizosphere microorganisms.

During epizootics in 2011 and 2012 in Durham, North Carolina, we observed a transition of fungal infections from one host, the plant-feeding fly Delia radicum, to a second host, the predatory fly Coenosia tigrina. Infections first appeared on Delia in the middle of March, but by the end of May, Coenosia comprised 100% of infected hosts. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that E. muscae in Durham comprises two distinct subpopulations (clades) with several haplotypes in each. Fungi from either clade are able to infect both fly species, but vary in their infection phenologies and host-specificities. Individuals of the more phylogenetically diverse clade I predominated during the beginning of the spring epizootic, infecting mostly phytophagous Delia flies. Clade II dominated in late April and May and affected mostly predatory Coenosia flies. Analysis of population structure revealed two subpopulations within E. muscae with limited gene exchange. This study provides the first evidence of recombination and population structure within the E. muscae species complex, and illustrates the complexity of insect-fungus relationships that should be considered for development of biological control methods.

Draft Assembly of Phytophthora capsici from Long-Read Sequencing Uncovers Complexity	MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS			English	Article						genomics; metabolomics; miniasm; MinION; nanopore sequencing; oomycete; pathogen; proteomics		Resolving complex plant pathogen genomes is important for identifying the genomic shifts associated with rapid adaptation to selective agents such as hosts and fungicides, yet assembling these genomes remains challenging and expensive. Phytophthora capsici is an important, globally distributed plant pathogen that exhibits widespread fungicide resistance and a broad host range. As with other pathogenic oomycetes, P. capsici has a complex life history and a complex genome. Here, we leverage Oxford Nanopore Technologies and existing short-read resources to rapidly generate a low-cost, improved assembly. We generated 10 Gbp from a single MinION flow cell resulting in >1.25 million reads with an N-50 of 13 kb. The resulting assembly is 95.2 Mbp in 424 scaffolds with an N-50 length of 313 kb. This assembly is approximately 30 Mbp bigger than the current reference genome of 64 Mbp. We confirmed this larger genome size using flow cytometry, with an estimated size of 110 Mbp. BUSCO analysis identified 97.4% complete orthologs (19.2% duplicated). Evolutionary analysis supports a recent whole-genome duplication in this group. Our work provides a blueprint for rapidly integrating benchtop long-read sequencing with existing short-read data, to dramatically improve assembly quality and integrity of complex genomes and offer novel insights into pathogen genome function and evolution.

This process is known as Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF), where through nitrogenase enzymes, N-2 is converted to an available form. This process can replace in part, or in total, nitrogen fertilizers. Cowpea bean is a legume species that is recognized for its high capacity to carry out BNF. In the last decades, studies have encouraged small farmers from north and northeast Brazil to use inoculants with rhizobia species since the results of researches have demonstrated that inoculation is an interesting strategy to improve cowpea production. Considering the specific function of molybdenum (Mo) in the N assimilation, different doses of Mo were tested in this study in order to find doses that could improve and enhance BNF. Therefore, this study aimed to compare nitrogen fertilization and BNF in the N assimilation by plants with different Mo doses. Inoculation was performed with the strains UFLA 03-84 and INPA 03-11B. Doses of Mo were applied in seeds and each pot contained five seeds. Thirty-five days after germination, the plants were analyzed for shoot dry matter and fresh matter, N contents and accumulation, as well as the Soil-Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) Index and nodulation in inoculated plants. The different doses of Mo and also the nodulation treatments did not show significant differences in the contents of N. Plants with N fertilization had significant higher shoot dry matter and root dry matter production, in addition to higher N foliar contents and N accumulation. Therefore, BNF was not as efficient as nitrogen fertilization in the evaluated experimental conditions using cowpea beans.

The impacts of rhizobacterial strains to alleviate salinity stress on the germination of Lactuca sativa and Raphanus sativus seeds were assessed using different concentrations of NaCl. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains were also examined to improve the early germination of Chinese cabbage seeds under normal conditions. Lactobacillus sp. and P. putida inoculation showed higher radicle lengths compared with non-inoculated radish (Raphanus sativus) seeds. LAP mix inoculation increased the radicle length of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seedlings by 2.0 and 0.5 cm at salinity stress of 50 and 100 mM NaCl concentration, respectively. Inoculation by Azotobacter chroococcum significantly increased the plumule and radicle lengths of germinated seeds compared with non-inoculated control. A. chroococcum increased the radicle length relative to the uninoculated seeds by 4.0, 1.0, and 1.5 cm at 50, 100, and 150 mM NaCl concentration, respectively. LAP mix inoculation significantly improved the radicle length in germinated radish seeds by 7.5, 1.3, 1.2, and 0.6 cm under salinity stress of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mM NaCl concentration, respectively. These results of this study showed that PGPR could be helpful to mitigate the salinity stress of different plants at the time of germination.

We also investigated the effects of fertilization on the number of insecticide applications needed to control F. occidentalis on potted chrysanthemum. Under greenhouse conditions, rate of change in population abundance of F. occidentalis increased with fertilization levels from 0 to 100% of the standard fertilization level (375 ppm N) and was four times higher on plants fertilized with the standard level (rate of change = 0.14) than on plants fertilized with 0% during the first 4 weeks after thrips inoculation. Within-plant distribution of F. occidentalis was influenced by the phenology of the plants rather than total nitrogen content of plant tissues. Prior to flower opening, more F. occidentalis were found in the middle region of the plants. When the flowers began to open, more thrips were found feeding inside the flowers than on the leaves. We further showed that production time, the time from transplantation to flower opening, shortened considerably with increased fertilization level. Production time was shortest, 12 weeks, for plants fertilized with 100% of the standard fertilization level. When the fertilization level was reduced to 20%, production time lengthened to 13 weeks. When fertilization level was reduced to 0%, production time lengthened to 14 weeks. Increased fertilization from 0 to 100% of the standard level did not result in higher numbers of insecticide applications. All three insecticides (acephate, bifenthrin, and spinosad) were effective in keeping the thrips infestation below a predetermined level, five thrips per plant, but bifenthrin required the most number of applications to do so. For chrysanthemum, a fast-growing crop and heavy utilizer of fertilizer, fertilization influenced not only the population growth of pest insects but also plant production time. As a result, optimizing fertilization level to reduce pest population growth may be a useful tactic in an Integrated Pest Management program for managing F. occidentalis on potted chrysanthemum. However, the effect of fertilization on production time and plant quality should also be considered when implementing this tactic.

This, in addition to increased awareness of organic farming, has generated considerable interest in the evaluation of renewable biofertilisers. Objective - The three objectives of the current research were: (1) to evaluate and optimise a solid phase extraction procedure for extraction of three plant hormones, IAA, GA(3) and ABA from two model biofertilisers produced from coconut shells and pineapple peels; (2) to develop an HPLC analysis procedure for the simultaneous separation and quantification of three plant hormones (IAA, GA(3) and ABA); and (3) to evaluate the changes in three plant hormones levels at four different fermentation time periods and varying number of general bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeast. Result - An optimised procedure for sample preparation, separation and simultaneous analysis of three plant hormones [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and abscisic acid (ABA)] produced in liquid biofertilisers was developed. This method involves sample cleanup using a Sep-pack Oasis (R) MAX cartridge containing mixed-mode anion-exchange and reverse-phase sorbents that provided optimum recovery of 85.6, 91.9 and 94.3%, respectively, for the three hormones, IAA, GA(3), and ABA. Baseline separation of three hormones was achieved using mobile phase consisting of 1% acetic acid and acetonitrile (75:25, v/v) at pH 4.0. The amounts of hormones produced in liquid biofertilisers were influenced by fruit types, fermentation time and total number of general bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. The quantities of three plant hormones produced during fermentation correlated well with the total number of microorganisms present in the liquid biofertilisers. Conclusion - A simple and rapid sample preparation procedure followed by RP-HPLC with UV detection was optimised and developed for simultaneous quantification and identification of three plant hormones namely, IAA, GA(3) and ABA in the liquid biofertilisers. This procedure allows quantification of the three plant hormones in their natural states without any prior derivatisation step. The results presented illustrate that the contents of the three plant hormones depended on the type of fruit wastes, fermentation time and the number of microorganisms found in liquid biofertilisers. This method can be extended to determine the quantity of three hormones in other matrices. This assay procedure will aid in the development of liquid biofertilisers, a valuable alternative fertilisers to promote plant growth. This process will help farmers to reduce production cost and pollution problems. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, germination and early life-history stages have seldom been considered in estimates of evolutionary adaptation. Moreover, whether soil microbial communities can influence evolutionary adaptation in plants remains little explored. Methods We used reciprocal transplant experiments to investigate whether two populations of an invasive plant Solidago canadensis that occur in contrasting habitats of low versus high salinity expressed adaptation to the respective salinity levels. We germinated S. canadensis seeds collected from low-and high-salinity habitats under low- and high-salt treatments. We also raised S. canadensis seedlings from the two salinity habitats under low- and high-salt treatments and in the presence versus absence of microbial communities from the two habitats. Results Genotypes from a low-salinity habitat had higher germination rates under low-salt treatment than genotypes from a high-salinity habitat. However, both genotypes had similar germination rates under a high-salt treatment. The two genotypes also had similar seedling survival and biomass responses to low- and high-salt treatments. Nevertheless, seedling biomass was significantly higher under low salt treatment. Soil microbial communities did not influence biomass of S. canadensis under the two salt treatments. Conclusions The results on germination rates suggest partial local adaptation to low salinity. However, there was no evidence of local adaptation to salinity at the seedling survival and growth stages. The finding that germination and seedling biomass responded to different salt treatments suggests that the two traits are important for salt tolerance.

The combination of 500 ppm rosemary extract and 500 ppm tocopherol had the highest antioxidant activity while the control group had the lowest antioxidant activity. The 500 ppm rosemary extract and 500 ppm tocopherol addition preserved color better than any other treatment. The multiplicative product of strong ripening time, antioxidant treatment interaction storage time and antioxidant treatment interaction (P < 0.0001) existed for 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances content. Microbiological properties were improved by antioxidant treatment with the best microbiological quality observed for sucuks having the 500 ppm rosemary extract and 500 ppm tocopherol. To preserve overall color, chemical and microbiological quality of sucuks during storage time, the rosemary extract and tocopherol combination can be used for the commercial processing of Turkish sucuks.

We hypothesized that corn SM may effectively control Parthenium hysterophorus. The growth traits, and the physico-chemical and microbiological properties of rhizosphere soils around P. hysterophorus were analyzed in 2014 and 2015. Compared to the control, plant emergence, biomass, plant height, leaf numbers, leaf area index, and flower and seed numbers significantly decreased in the SM treatments. Flowering time was delayed by 5-11 days, pH was slightly reduced, and organic matter and available N/P/K increased in the rhizosphere. The number of culturable bacteria fell slightly during plant emergence, but bacteria levels increased significantly during flowering. Nitrospira and Actinobacteria dominated the microbial communities and their composition ratio increased under SM. The results suggest that SM affects rhizosphere microbial community composition, and the emergence and growth of P. hysterophorus.

Introduction to the sampling designs of the National Ecological Observatory Network Terrestrial Observation System	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						beetles; biogeochemistry; birds; disease; mosquitoes; plants; small mammals; soil microbes; Special Feature: NEON Design	AQUATIC SCIENCES; SCALE; NEON	Global change drivers influence ecological processes at multiple scales and manifest across most of Earth as changes in biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, infectious disease incidence, and ecohydrology. Small-scale investigations provide compelling evidence of specific effects of global change on local systems, but are of limited use in modeling complex ecological processes at continental-to-global scales. Long-term observations distributed across a diversity of habitat types are needed to improve the ability to forecast ecological change at large spatial and temporal scales. This special issue introduces the Terrestrial Observation System (TOS) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), a long-term, continental-scale ecological research platform designed to deliver these large-scale datasets. The TOS measures biodiversity of key biota (soil microbes, insects, plants, small mammals), ecosystem productivity and biogeochemistry, infectious disease dynamics, phenology, and population dynamics. The articles in this special issue describe the scientific rationale for the sampling designs of the TOS, including an overview of protocols, locations, and frequencies of measurements. The science designs are a culmination of design requirements scoped by NEON and the National Science Foundation, best available practices put forth by the scientific community, input from technical working groups, and consideration of logistical and financial constraints by NEON staff. Within each site, measurements have been collocated to the extent possible to optimize linkages among different sampling elements. Integrated analyses of terrestrial observations with sensor-based, imagery, and remote-sensing data collected by other NEON subsystems can facilitate scaling of measured parameters to larger spatial and temporal scales. NEON is designed to collect data for 30 years, and make these data freely available on a public data portal (data.neonscience.org).

MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL; STRESS; SALINITY; GROWTH; PROLINE; SODIUM; OSMOREGULATION; ACCUMULATION; CULTIVARS	This study aimed to investigate the effect of inoculation with plant growth-promoting Rhizobium and Pseudomonas species on NaCl-affected maize. Two cultivars of maize (cv. Agaiti 2002 and cv. Av 4001) selected on the basis of their yield potential were grown in pots outdoors under natural conditions during July. Microorganisms were applied at seedling stage and salt stress was induced 21 days after sowing and maintained up to 50% flowering after 120 days of stress. The salt treatment caused a detrimental effect on growth and development of plants. Co-inoculation resulted in some positive adaptative responses of maize plants under salinity. The salt tolerance from inoculation was generally mediated by decreases in electrolyte leakage and in osmotic potential, an increase in osmoregulant (proline) production, maintenance of relative water content of leaves, and selective uptake of K ions. Generally, the microbial strain acted synergistically. However, under unstressed conditions, Rhizobium was more effective than Pseudomonas but under salt stress the favorable effect was observed even if some exceptions were also observed. The maize cv. Agaiti 2002 appeared to be more responsive to inoculation and was relatively less tolerant to salt compared to that of cv. Av 4001.

Its manufacturing process can be very diverse, especially regarding the maturation temperature and the NaCl concentration used for the brine; thereby, the main goal of this study was to investigate the impact of those parameters on the microbiota developed during curing and ripening. Three farms producing Lard d'Arnad were selected. Two plants, reflecting the industrial process characterized either by low maturation temperature (plant A [10% NaCl, 2 degrees C]) or by using a low NaCl concentration (plant B [2.5% NaCl, 4 degrees C]), were selected, while the third was characterized by an artisanal process (plant C [30% NaCl, 8 degrees C]). Lard samples were obtained at time 0 and after 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days of maturation. From each plant, 3 independent lots were analyzed. The diversity of live microbiota was evaluated by using classical plate counts and amplicon target sequencing of small subunit (SSU) rRNA. The main taxa identified by sequencing were Acinetobacter johnsonii, Psychrobacter, Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus sciuri, Pseudomonas fragi, Brochothrix, Halomonas, and Vibrio, and differences in their relative abundances distinguished samples from the individual plants. The composition of the microbiota was more similar among plants A and B, and it was characterized by the higher presence of taxa recognized as undesired bacteria in food-processing environments. Oligotype analysis of Halomonas and Acinetobacter revealed the presence of several characteristic oligotypes associated with A and B samples.

Organochlorine pesticide (OCP) levels were quantified by GC-ECD in vegetative tissues (roots and aerial), bulk soil and rhizosphere. Leek plant bioaccumulate OCPs efficiently in their aerial and root tissues and alter the concentration of the soil where they are grown. OCPs distribution pattern of bulk soil was enclosulfans > DDTs > dieldrin, while it was enclosulfans > HCHs > DDTs in leek tissues. There were statistically significant declines in DDTs, chlordane, dieldrin, and heptachlor in the rhizosphere, indicating that recalcitrant residues of OCPs may be removed from contaminated soil using leek crops under normal growing conditions. The DDE/DDT and alpha-/gamma-HCH ratios of < 1 would indicate recent inputs of DDT and lindane in the environment. The occurrence of OCPs in this farm could be the result of atmospheric deposition and/or surface runoff of these pesticides.

Zodiac x accession 5320 as parents. Plants were graft-inoculated when 6 weeks old to ensure successful and uniform infection. To exclude variation in seed transmission rates due to virus isolate or temperature, only 1 AMV isolate was used and the plants were kept under uniform temperature conditions. In M. polymorpha, significant differences were found between accessions in the levels of AMV transmitted through seed to progeny seedlings, SA 8250 giving the highest mean level of seed transmission (52%) and SA 4188 the lowest (3%). Neither virus concentration nor symptom severity influenced the rates of seed transmission obtained. However, part of the variation in seed transmission rates found in these accessions was related to their flowering times, seed transmission rates increasing as the interval between inoculation end flowering increased. In seed samples collected from individual graft-inoculated plants of M. murex from (i) the F-2 generation from crosses and reciprocal crosses, and (ii) the backcross progenies, the rates of transmission of AMV through seed to seedlings ranged from 0 to 77% and showed a continuous pattern of variation. Also, there was evidence of transgressive segregation for the low seed transmission rate condition. This indicates that the low seed transmission rate condition for AMV in medics is quantitatively inherited and under polygenic control. In contrast: when the pods from F-2 progeny plants from the crosses and reciprocal crosses were examined, the segregation ratios obtained revealed that the smooth pod character from parent accession 5320 was controlled by a single recessive gene, for which the name sp is proposed. The presence in a plant of gene sp, or of its spiny pod-determining allele from the other parent cv. Zodiac, was not correlated with, low seed transmission rates of AMV. It is concluded that selection for low rates of seed transmission and a population breeding approach can be used to produce improved M. polymorpha and M. murex cultivars with good resistance to seed-borne AMV.

Planting Date and Seed Treatment Effects on Soybean in the Northeastern United States	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							YIELD COMPONENTS; APHID HEMIPTERA; SYSTEMS	Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production is limited in the northeastern United States so research on optimum planting date is scarce. Soybean production in this region may increase because of biodiesel demand so we initiated a 2-yr study in New York that compared soybean planting dates with and without seed-applied fungicide/insecticide treatments. Soybean planted in mid-compared with late May had a longer emergence time (15 and 6 d) and lower plant densities (35.6 and 39.5 plants m(-2)), but produced more pods side branch(-1) (7.4 and 5-5), which contributed to more pods plant(-1) (30.9 and 25.7) and pods m(-2) (1079 and 958, respectively). The late compared with mid-May planting date, however, had more seeds pod(-1) (2.28 and 2.19), which contributed to similar seeds m(-2) (2180 and 2357) and seed yield (3.8 and 3.9 Mg ha(-1), respectively). Soybean planted in mid-June compared with mid-May had more plants m(-2) (38.0) but fewer pods side branch(-1) (3.4), pods plant(-1) (22.5), pods m(-2) (879), seeds m(-2) (1910), and lower seed yield (3.5 Mg ha(-1)). Seed treatments did not affect plant density, pod density, and seed yield, but had inconsistent effects on seeds pod(-1), seeds m(-2), and seed mass. The results of this study indicate that there is a fairly broad optimum planting date range and that insecticide/fungicide seed treatment is not required for soybean production in the northeastern United States, but more research is necessary to corroborate these findings.

In the disease system, thrips not only damage plants through feeding but also transmit causative agents of epidemics. In addition, thrips are infected with tospoviruses in the course of virus transmission. Most studies on the effect of tospoviruses on vector thrips have focused on the Tomato spotted wilt virus-Frankliniella occidentalis system. Thus, we focused on another thrips-borne tospovirus, Watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV), to examine the effect of virus infection on its vector, Thrips palmi. In this study, the direct and indirect effects of WSMoV on the life history traits and feeding preference of T. palmi were examined. The survival rate and developmental time of the WSMoV-infected larval thrips did not differ significantly from those of the virus-free thrips. Comparing the developmental time of larval thrips fed on the healthy plants, thrips-damaged plants, and thrips-inoculated plants (the WSMoV-infected plants caused by thrips feeding), feeding on the thrips-damaged plants reduced the developmental time, and the WSMoV infection in host plants partially canceled the effect of thrips damage on the developmental time. In addition, no significant variations between the virus-free and WSMoV-infected adult thrips regarding longevity and fecundity were observed. These results implied that WSMoV did not directly affect the life history traits of T. palmi, but the WSMoV infection indirectly affected the development of T. palmi through the virus-infected plants. Furthermore, feeding preference tests indicated that T. palmi preferred feeding on either the thrips-damaged plants or the thrips-inoculated plants to the healthy plants. The effect of tospoviruses on the life history and feeding preference of vector thrips might vary among host plants, virus species, vector species, and environmental factors.

The potential of strain GA1 to reduce post-harvest infection caused by B. cinerea was tested on apples by treating artificially wounded fruits with endospore suspensions. Strain GA1 was very effective at reducing disease incidence during the first 5 days following pathogen inoculation and a 80% protection level was maintained over the next 10 days. Treatment of fruits with an extract of GA1 culture supernatant also exerted a strong preventive effect on the development of grey mould. Further analysis of this extract revealed that strain GA1 produces a wide variety of antifungal lipopeptide isomers from the iturin, fengycin and surfactin families. A strong evidence for the involvement of such compounds in disease reduction arose from the recovery of fengycins from protected fruit sites colonized by bacterial cells. Conclusions: The results presented here demonstrate that, despite unfavourable pH, B. subtilis endospores inoculated on apple pulp can readily germinate allowing significant cell populations to establish and efficient in vivo synthesis of lipopeptides which could be related to grey mould reduction. Significance and Impact of the Study: This work enables for the first time to correlate the strong protective effect of a particular B. subtilis strain against grey mould with in situ production of fengycins in infected sites of apple fruits.

Grass persistence and endophyte maintenance in host populations are closely related, but could become independent due to endophyte loss mechanisms. We used native grass and endophyte populations to test the hypothesis that fungal endophytes manipulate grass persistence strategies to secure endophyte maintenance in plant populations. Two conditions were required to verify this hypothesis: 1) the fungus caused alterations in host plant strategies; and 2) plant phenotypic changes induced by the fungal endophyte increased endophyte transmission. We compared symbiotic (S) and non-symbiotic (NS) persistence strategies of Festuca eskia (Poaceae), an alpine grass infected by the asexual form of the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae. We characterised endophyte transmission efficiency, and described vegetative growth and sexual reproduction in a field population that naturally supports approximately 50% S plants. We built a demographic model to estimate plant vegetative growth rates. A correlation between plant persistence strategy, and fungal maintenance was evaluated by increasing soil resource levels. Under natural conditions, S and NS plants exploited different persistence strategies in the same population; S plants exhibited greater vegetative growth than their NS counterparts, while maintaining the same reproductive output. In response to higher soil resource levels, S plants shifted in persistence strategies and phenology, whereas NS plants maintained the same strategies. Therefore, results suggested the fungal endophyte fine-tuned host persistence strategies according to soil resource level. Finally, we found no direct relationship between the changes induced by fungal endophyte and endophyte transmission. Consequently, fungal endophytes affected host persistence strategies, but did not directly increase endophyte transmission.

These strains were evaluated for their plant growth-promoting (PGP) characteristics, including IAA and siderophore production and phosphate solubilization. These traits were dependent on bacterial phylogenetic position but independent of isolation sources. Twenty-four phylogenetically distinct strains were selected and evaluated for their effects on the plant performance of A. adenophora and the two native plants Fallopia multiflora and Arthraxon lanceolatus. All strains had a neutral influence on germination rate; however, the germination timing and aboveground and belowground growth of the three tested plants were significantly changed. Among all tested strains, 20.8% and 16.7% were beneficial for the aboveground and belowground growth of A. adenophora, but none were beneficial to the two native species. In contrast, no strain negatively affected the performance of A. adenophora, but more than half of the strains showed detrimental effects on the belowground growth of the two native species, and approximately half of them delayed the germination timing of F. multiflora. The phylogenetic position of strains distinctly affected plant performance. The bacteria accumulated in the rhizosphere soil of A. adenophora showed a host-specific growth-promotion of A. adenophora; however, such bacteria showed no more detrimental effects on the growth of the two native species than those inhabiting the native plants. Our data suggested that the increased bacterial number and altered species structure in the soils were able to provide a competitive advantage to A. adenophora after invasion. (C) 2019 SAAB.

Their enzymatic repertoire, as well as the one of their associated microbiota, has contributed to their colonization success. Together, these holobionts have evolved several interesting life history traits to degrade the plant cell walls, mainly composed of lignocellulose. It has been shown that terrestrial isopods achieve lignocellulose degradation thanks to numerous and diverse CAZymes provided by both the host and its microbiota. Nevertheless, the strategies for lignocellulose degradation seem more diversified in isopods, in particular in aquatic species which are the least studied. Isopods could be an interesting source of valuable enzymes for biotechnological industries of biomass conversion.ResultsTo provide new features on the lignocellulose degradation in isopod holobionts, shotgun sequencing of 36 metagenomes of digestive and non-digestive tissues was performed from several populations of four aquatic and terrestrial isopod species. Combined to the 15 metagenomes of an additional species from our previous study, as well as the host transcriptomes, this large dataset allowed us to identify the CAZymes in both the host and the associated microbial communities. Analyses revealed the dominance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the five species, covering 36% and 56% of the total bacterial community, respectively. The identification of CAZymes and new enzymatic systems for lignocellulose degradation, such as PULs, cellulosomes and LPMOs, highlights the richness of the strategies used by the isopods and their associated microbiota.ConclusionsAltogether, our results show that the isopod holobionts are promising models to study lignocellulose degradation. These models can provide new enzymes and relevant lignocellulose-degrading bacteria strains for the biotechnological industries of biomass conversion.

The first steps of exudate utilization by microorganisms define all further flows of root C in the soil, including recycling and stabilization. Nevertheless, most studies have traced root exudates C much later after its initial uptake by microorganisms. To understand microbial uptake and utilization of rice root exudates, we traced C-13 incorporated into microbial groups by C-13 profiles of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) within a short time (6 h) after (CO2)-C-13 pulse labeling. Labeling was conducted five times during three growth stages: active root growth (within the 21 days after transplanting), rapid shoot growth (37 and 45 days), and rapid reproduction (53 and 63 days). C-13 was quickly assimilated throughout the rhizosphere microorganism, and the incorporation rate increased with rice maturity. Despite low redox conditions in paddy soil, fungi outcompeted bacteria in utilizing the root exudates. At all growth stages, fungal PLFAs (18:2 w6, 9c/18:0) showed the highest C-13 levels, whereas actinomycete PLFAs (16:0 10-methyl) showed the lowest C-13 incorporation. Principal component analysis revealed that the rhizosphere microbial community differed among rice growth stages, whereas the whole microbial community remained stable. In conclusion, the rapid incorporation of carbon from root exudates into microorganisms in paddy soils depends on the growth stage of the rice plant and is the first step of C utilization in rice rhizosphere, further defining C utilization and stabilization.

Saprotrophy of Conidiobolus and Basidiobolus in leaf litter	MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Collembola; Entomophthorales; fungal ecology; litter ecology; Niche differentiation	NUMERICAL TAXONOMY; REPETITIONAL CONIDIA; ENTOMOPHTHORALES; FUNGI; GERMINATION; SYSTEMATICS; CORONATUS; REQUIREMENTS; LAMPRAUGES; SEQUENCES	This study of the putative saprotrophs of Conidiobolus and Basidiobolus aids the understanding of their ecological roles in litter, and their relationship with the entomogenous fungi of the Entomophthorales. A total of 47 isolates (ten spp.) were screened for their ability to utilise pure compounds, arthropod cadavers, and plant leaf fragments as substrates. Isolates co-occurred in a larch plantation (Larix sp.) or were from adjacent habitats. Of the 21 isolates (nine spp.) tested on potential prime carbon sources, none could utilise common plant structural polymers. Conidiobolus adiaeretus, C. iuxtagenitus, and B. ranarum from litter and some soil isolates of C. heterosporus, C. pumilus, and C. firmipilleus could use starches and glycogen. In marked contrast, all could utilise animal chitin, gelatine, casein, N-acetyl glucosamine, and trehalose. The lipids tributyrin and sunflower oil also supported growth. Conidia on cadavers usually led to high levels of colonisation as was the case for 30 isolates (ten species). Collembola were more frequently and rapidly colonised than mites. Cadavers of many other arthropods were also internally colonised. The ability to utilise cadavers of diverse arthropods indicates that trophic competition between co-occurring test species may be minimal. Niche differentiation may depend more on non-trophic features of their life history. Negative correlation of performance with the presence of naturally occurring, non-test fungi suggests competition with (or antibiosis from) at least some of the other fungi. In washed or unwashed plant fragments of larch litter (F-layer) only occasional local growth and resting spore formation occurred. Extra nutrients did not facilitate colonisation. Alternative forms of repetitional conidia showed a strong association with plant fragments but not with cadavers. (C) 2007 The British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Exposure to a pine pathogen enhances growth and disease resistance in Pinus radiata seedlings	FOREST PATHOLOGY			English	Article							ECTOMYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; RED PINE; GIBBERELLA-FUJIKUROI; FUSARIUM-CIRCINATUM; PLANT; ENDOPHYTES; MORTALITY; PATULA; STANDS; DAMAGE	Most studies of Fusarium circinatum, the cause of pitch canker in pines, have focused on its activity as a pathogen. However, recent findings indicate that this fungus can colonize roots of Pinus radiata without inducing symptoms. Contrary to expectations, this study revealed that seedlings grown in infested sand grew more rapidly than seedlings not exposed to F. circinatum, based on root and shoot biomass, with modifications to root system architecture, including increased mycorrhizal root development. These effects were dependent on inoculum density and duration following growth in infested rooting medium. Plants exposed to F. circinatum expressed elevated resistance to stem infections, which significantly decreased the incidence of mortality; as above, effects were dependent on inoculum density. Resistance to stem infections was also enhanced in seedlings that emerged through infested litter, as occurs in native stands. Beneficial to neutral interactions of F. circinatum with its host suggest that the life history of this fungus may be more complex than previously recognized, with activities similar to non-pathogenic endophytes. The potential for non-lethal infections by F. circinatum to induce resistance in seedlings may influence dynamics of stand establishment. Overall, these results indicate that pathogenic organisms with asymptomatic states may have cryptic ecological functions that extend beyond the impacts of disease.	[Swett, C.

Ecosystem recovery: heathland response to a reduction in nitrogen deposition	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						Calluna; dwarf shrub community; eutrophication; Gothenburg Protocol; lichen cover; lowland heathland; microbial activity	SOIL SOLUTION CHEMISTRY; ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; CALLUNA-VULGARIS; VEGETATION; RESTORATION; SENSITIVITY; GARDSJON; REMOVAL; IMPACTS	Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen is responsible for widespread changes in the structure and function of sensitive seminatural ecosystems. The proposed reduction in emissions of nitrogenous pollutants in Europe under the Gothenburg Protocol raises the question of whether affected ecosystems have the potential to recover to their previous condition and, if so, over what timescale. Since 1998, we have monitored the response of a lowland heathland in southern England following the cessation of a long-term nitrogen addition experiment, and subsequent management, assessing changes in vegetation growth and chemistry, soil chemistry and the soil microbial community. Persistent effects of earlier nutrient loading on Calluna growth and phenology, and on the abundance of lichens, were apparent up to 8 years after nitrogen additions ceased, indicating the potential for long-term effects of modest nutrient loading (up to 15.4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), over 7 years) on heathland ecosystems. The size and activity of the soil microbial community was elevated in former N-treated plots, 6-8 years after additions ceased, suggesting a prolonged effect on the rate of nutrient cycling. Although habitat management in 1998 reduced nitrogen stores in plant biomass, effects on belowground nitrogen stores were small. Although some parameters (e.g. soil pH) recover pretreatment levels relatively rapidly, others (e.g. vegetation cover and microbial activity) respond much more slowly, indicating that the ecological effects of even small increases in nitrogen deposition will persist for many years after deposition inputs are reduced. Indeed, calculations suggest that the additional soil nitrogen storage associated with 7 years of experimental nitrogen inputs could sustain the observed effects on plant growth and phenology for several decades. Carry over effects on plant phenology and sensitivity to drought suggest that the persistence of vegetation responses to nitrogen deposition should be integrated into long-term assessments of the impact of global climate change on sensitive ecosystems.

Don ex Royle. Sodium hypochlorite (4%) treatment improves seed germination (82 +/- 7.64%). For vegetative propagation, IBA 100 ppm treatment produced 3 +/- 1.07 bulblets/scale. We achieved multi-bulblet formation through in vitro seed germination and callus culture using bulb scales on MS medium. The study reports 91% in vitro germination using chipped seed, treated with IBA 100 ppm within 14-18 days of inoculation. This is the first report of germination >90% within <20 days in the genus Lilium having hypogeal germination. After 18 days of germination, the in vitro seedlings showed multi-bulblet structures. Bulb scales maximum callusing (69 + 6.94%) and bulblet formation (1.7 +/- 0.18 bulblets/scale) were observed in MS medium supplemented with IBA 25 mu M. Bulblet formation was observed after four weeks following two sub-cultures on the same medium. Later individual bulblets were hardened with >40% survival after a year. The study can serve as a tool of mass multiplication for in situ and ex situ conservation of the species. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Why some herbaceous plant species refrain from sprouting in some years is a longstanding puzzle in plant ecology. When vegetatively 'dormant', the plant lives as a rootstock, but does not produce or maintain photosynthetic tissue. During this time, energy may be remobilized from resource reserves or acquired from mycorrhizal fungi, although the mechanisms are still poorly understood. If vegetative dormancy is adaptive, it may be in response to a harsh environment, to life-history costs, or as a bet-hedge against unpredictable environmental variability. 2. We tested whether vegetative dormancy is adaptive via game theoretical analysis of deterministic and stochastic ahistorical and historical life-history models parameterized with long-term census data for two long-lived plants, Anemone americana and Cypripedium parviflorum. The ahistorical deterministic model provided a test of the hypothesis that dormancy is adaptive in response to a generally harsh environment and/or short-term life-history costs, while the historical model tested whether long-term costs drove the evolution of dormancy. The stochastic ahistorical model provided a test of whether dormancy is a bet-hedging trait. 3. We found that vegetative dormancy is an adaptive consequence of life-history costs of growth to survival and that these costs may be operating under a variable but generally harsh environment. Such costs led to sprouting and survival probabilities that generally increased with size in adults but never reached unity and decreased with size in juveniles. Historical deterministic models particularly predicted observed sprouting frequencies, while deterministic ahistorical and stochastic models did not, suggesting although the environment is likely stressful and fluctuates between harsh and mild states, short-term costs and temporal stochasticity alone do not explain observed sprouting frequencies. 4. Synthesis. Life-history costs can drive the evolution of seemingly paradoxical traits. In particular, growth can lead to survival costs that may become significant in future years. These costs may be incurred via the use of stored reserves that, once used, cannot be used in the next several years. Such costs are the currency favouring the evolutionary maintenance of vegetative dormancy in two distantly related perennial plant species and may account for dormancy throughout the plant kingdom.

To generate a differential inoculum potential of indigenous AM fungi, two cycles of maize, each of 3 weeks, were grown in sieved or undisturbed soil before soybeans were sown. The maize plants from undisturbed soil were taller and produced twice as much biomass (1.2 g dry weight per plant) as plants from sieved soil (0.6 g dry weight per plant). Soil disturbance decreased P uptake from 2.7 to 0.8 mg P per plant, and decreased IN accumulation from 39 to 18 mg N per plant. These results were consistent with those from previous studies that indicated that improved growth was related to the presence of an intact, extraradical mycelium in the soil at the start of AM fungal colonization of maize roots. Soybean plants grown in undisturbed soil developed faster and accumulated 42% more dry matter by pod-fill than did plants from sieved soil. There was a positive interaction between the two microbial symbionts in undisturbed soil that resulted in more rapid colonization of soybean roots by both microbes, as indicated by nodule number and frequency of arbuscules. Although nodule numbers became the same after 23 days, irrespective of the degree of disturbance, at pod-fill dry weight of nodules was almost four times greater in undisturbed than in sieved soil (42 mg per plant compared with 12 mg). The effect of disturbance on the mass of N-2 fixed was determined using 15 N dilution, and reflected the difference in nodule weight. The percentage of plant N derived from the atmosphere decreased from 32% in undisturbed soil to 12% in sieved soil. Colonization of soybean roots by AM fungi was still greater at pod-fill in undisturbed soil. Plants apparently started taking up P only after 10 days from emergence in undisturbed soil, and only after 23 days in sieved soil. These results establish that tillage can modify the interaction between indigenous AM fungi, B. japonicum, and soybean, and that all of the effects appear not to be solely a function of P uptake.

Experiments were carried out in two areas in Santa Luzia do Parua, Maranhao state, Brazil, in the Pre-Amazon region, in 2009. The BR 3299, BR 3262, INPA 03-11B Bradyrhizobium strains, an absolute control, and a nitrogen treatment (80 kg ha(-1) N) were tested. At 30 and 50 days after emergence (DAE) of plants assesments were made. At 65 DAE, grain yield was evaluated. The number and dry weight of nodules, shoot dry mass, relative efficiency, and N accumulation in shoots were evaluated. All strains provided higher values for number and dry weight of nodules, and higher productivity in comparsion to the absolute control, without inoculation and urea, in the two areas. Regarding shoot dry matter, relative efficiency, and N accumulation in shoots, BR 3299 differed significantly from the absolute control, at 30 DAE, in one of the farms. Cowpea yield responds positively to inoculation with strains, especially strain BR 3299.

The objective of this study was to combine the advantages of matriconditioning with effective fungicide treatments to further improve emergence and yield in table beet (Beta vulgaris L. cv. Ruby Queen). Of the various carriers used, Micro-Cel E (a synthetic calcium silicate) was found to be more effective than expanded vermiculite or Agro-Lig (a Leonardite shale). The conditioning mixture consisted of 1 part seed to 0.2 part Micro-Cel E to 1.15 part water (or fungicide suspension) by weight. Seeds were conditioned for 7 d at 15-degrees-C. Although washing after conditioning improved the early emergence, air-drying of conditioned seeds, with or without washing, was essential for obtaining maximum stand. A combined treatment of conditioning and metalaxyl [(N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-N-(methoxyacetyl) alanine methyl ester] + tolclofos-methyl (O-2,6-dichloro-4-methylphenyl O,O-dimethyl phosphorothioate) was more effective than the conditioning or fungicide seed treatment alone in improving stand and in reducing seedling mortality at 22 to 25-degrees-C in soil infested with soilborne pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn. In noninfested soil, conditioning with metalaxyl + thiram (tetramethylthiuram disulfide) was most effective. At 15-degrees-C, conditioning in combination with metalaxyl + tolclofos-methyl or metalaxyl + thiram induced earlier emergence and produced larger stands than did conditioning or fungicide treatment alone. In a filed trial planted on 1 May 1990, conditioning combined with metalaxyl + tolclofos-methyl or metalaxyl + thiram produced a larger stand than did conditioning or fungicide treatment alone. In a field trial planted on 21 June 1990 and artificially infested with mycelial suspensions of R. solani and Pythium ultimum Trow, conditioning combined with metalaxyl + tolclofos-methyl or metalaxyl + thiram reduced the early emergence time and increased the marketable root yield over that of conditioning or fungicide treatment alone. Root disease incidence was reduced maximally when conditioning was combined with metalaxyl + tolclofos-methyl, to a lesser extent by fungicides alone, and none by conditioning alone.

Eggshell bacterial load has been shown to predict hatching failure (i.e. the probability of embryo infection) but the relationships between the bacterial environment of the nest and life history characteristics of birds remain poorly investigated. We explored interspecific variation in eggshell bacterial load of mesophilic bacteria, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae groups across 24 bird species and assessed whether bacterial load is associated with breeding traits. Interspecific variation was much higher than intra-specific variation for all measures of bacterial load even after controlling for annual variation. Thus, we were able to assess the correlation between bacterial community characteristics and life history traits. After correcting for phylogenetic effects, we found that nest type, the use of feathers or plants as lining material, and incubation behaviour explained a significant proportion of the variance in bacterial communities on eggshells. The strength of these associations depended on study year, suggesting an important role of environmental conditions for eggshell bacterial load or community. Overall, these results suggest that bacteria on eggshells are associated with bird species traits, probably because birds are mediating the deleterious effect of eggshell microbes through behavioural traits that modify bacterial load.

L.) families were planted in Michigan and Oregon to determine variability among families, locations and the importance of family X location interaction. The families were generated at Michigan State University from crosses among parents with a diverse genetic background. Seedlings were planted in field locations in Corvallis, Ore., and East Lansing, Mich., in 1995 and managed following standard commercial blueberry production practices with no insecticide or fungicide applications. In 1998-2000 the plants were evaluated for survival, bloom date, ripening date, plant growth and the fruit were scored for crop load, color, picking scar, firmness and size. All traits, except fruit color, varied significantly between locations. Plants in Oregon had a 36% greater survival rate and grew to be much larger, 80% taller and 104 % wider, than those in Michigan. Families in Oregon flowered earlier in the year than those in Michigan but ripened at a similar time. Between locations, family differences were only evident for survival and fruit color. In Oregon, there were differences among families for all traits whereas in Michigan only survival, ripening date, plant height and width, and picking scar differed significantly. The family x environment interaction was not significant for crop load, fruit color and fruit firmness, so individuals selected on the basis of crop load, fruit color and fruit firmness should perform similarly in either location. There was a significant family x environment interaction for the other traits including survival, bloom date, ripening date, ripening interval, plant height and width, and for picking scar. Therefore, there is a need for individual selection programs at each location. Genotypes well adapted to Michigan may also do well in Oregon, but numerous promising genotypes could be missed for Oregon, if families are first selected in Michigan. The loss of numerous individuals due to winter cold may have reduced levels of variability in Michigan.

The aim of the paper was to evaluate the effects of biofertilizer produced by mixing different types and proportions of organic matter inoculated with the diazotrophic bacteria Beijerinckia indica. The experiment consisted of plastic trays (6 L) containing 5 kg of three different types of organic matter (filter mud cake, earthworm compost, and crop residue) applied in the following proportions (v: v: v): 1-(5: 0: 0), 2( 4: 1: 0), 3-(4: 0: 1), 4-(3: 2: 0), 5-(3: 1: 1), 6-(3: 0: 2), 7-(2: 3: 0), 8-(2: 2: 1), 9-(2: 1: 2), 10-(2: 0: 3), 11-(1: 4: 0), 12-(1: 3: 1), 13-(1: 2: 2), 14-(1: 1: 3), 15-(1: 0: 4), 16-(0: 5: 0), 17-(0: 4: 1), 18-(0: 1: 4), 19-(0: 3: 2), 20-(0: 2: 3), and 21-(0: 0: 5). Samples were collected following inoculation with B. indica at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days of the maturation phase. The chemical analyses were: pH (H2O), total C and N, available P and K, and exchangeable Na+, Ca+2, Mg+2. The treatments with the best results showed significant effects following the maturation phase. The exceptions were C and N, which presented only individual effects. In general, the organic matter proportions (5: 0: 0), (3: 2: 0), and (2: 3: 0) resulted in a significant increase in the availability of nutrients. Biofertilizers with optimal organic matter proportions may be used to produce organic substrates that are more effective and have the potential to be applied as alternatives to soluble NPK fertilizers.

Background and aims: Fungicides, though beneficial for agricultural productivity, are known to interfere with the basic metabolism and induce the formation of various biomolecules and also alter the physiological parameters of plant growth. The present study is an attempt to understand the effect of different conc, of benzimidazole (Carbendazim) and dithocarbamate (Mancozeb) fungicides on photosynthetic components such as chlorophyll content, total sugar and phenolic content and various antioxidative enzymes in developing seedlings of chickpea. Material and Methods: Chickpea seeds of two cultivars (PDG-4 and GPF-2) were incubated with different conc. (0.1, 0.25 and 0.5%) of the fungicide for 24 and 48 h and then allowed to germinate for 10 days in an incubated chamber. Seedlings were analyzed for various physiological parameters such as variation in root/shoot length, photosynthetic activity (chlorophyll content), total sugar and phenolic content and activity of antioxidative enzymes such as GPX, CAT and SOD etc. Results and conclusions: Compared to the unstressed samples, fungicide stress resulted in an overall decrease in root/shoot length, relative water content etc. thus indicating that the applied fungicides adversely affects the rate of germination of seedlings. A differential behaviour of various chlorophyll (Chla, Chlb, total chlorophyll) contents suggests that fungicides stress affects the photosynthetic machinery. Estimations of sugar and total phenolic content indicated that higher conc. of the fungicide lowered the total sugar content at the 10-day-old seedling stage; thereby giving an indication that the fungicide may interferes with carbohydrate metabolism. We observed that the level of peroxidase increased at higher conc. of the both types of fungicide as compared to control samples whereas the catalase activity increased in PDG 4 but a lower activity was observed in GPF-2 under increasing conc. of both the fungicides. The levels of superoxide dismutase decreased in PDG-4 but increased in GPF-2 under higher conc. of both the fungicides thus indicating that different varieties of chickpea behaved differently and triggers various antioxidant enzymes as defence mechanism to counter the fungicides stress.

However, inducible changes in the production of defensive chemicals are described mostly in plants and surprisingly little is known about similar plasticity in chemical defences of animals. Inducible chemical defences may be common in animals because many are known to produce toxins, the synthesis of toxins is likely to be costly, and there are a few known cases of animals adjusting their toxin production to changes in environmental conditions. We outline what is known about the occurrence of inducible chemical defences in animals and argue that there is immense potential for progress in this field. Possible directions include surveying diverse taxa to explore how general its occurrence may be and testing for selection acting on inducible chemical defences. Data on inducible chemical defences would provide insight into life-history tradeoffs by enabling novel tests of how time-costs and resource-costs affect life-history. If the synthesis of toxic compounds by animals proves accessible to manipulation, as it is in plants and fungi, this will open the way to refined estimates of the fitness costs of defence, ultimately providing a clearer picture of how plasticity evolves and is maintained in nature.

However, the debate about chemical control is fueling a promotion toward alternative methods. In this context, the enhancement of natural plant immunity could be a strategy for more sustainable protection. We previously demonstrated that a concentrated culture filtrate (CCF) of P. infestans primes defense reactions in potato. They are genotype-dependent and metabolites produced decrease pathogen growth in vitro but not in vivo on tubers. Induced potato defenses are assumed to affect P. infestans life history traits depending on strains. This assumption was studied in vivo through induced leaflets on a susceptible genotype inoculated with four P infestans strains differing for lesion growth rate. This study combines both defenses mechanistic analysis and ecological observations. Defense-gene expressions were thus assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; pathogen development was simultaneously evaluated by measuring necrosis, quantifying mycelial DNA, and counting sporangia. The results showed that CCF pretreatment reduced the pathogenicity differences between slow- and fast-growing strains. Moreover, after elicitation, PR-1, PR-4, PAL, POX, and THT induction was strain-dependent. These results suggest that P. infestans could develop different strategies to overcome plant defenses and should be considered in biocontrol and epidemic management of late blight.

Multiple regimes of robust patterns between network structure and biodiversity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; DISENTANGLING NESTEDNESS; INFECTION NETWORKS; STABILITY; ARCHITECTURE; BACTERIA; SYSTEMS	Ecological networks such as plant-pollinator and host-parasite networks have structured interactions that define who interacts with whom. The structure of interactions also shapes ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Yet, there is significant ongoing debate as to whether certain structures, e.g., nestedness, contribute positively, negatively or not at all to biodiversity. We contend that examining variation in life history traits is key to disentangling the potential relationship between network structure and biodiversity. Here, we do so by analyzing a dynamic model of virus-bacteria interactions across a spectrum of network structures. Consistent with prior studies, we find plausible parameter domains exhibiting strong, positive relationships between nestedness and biodiversity. Yet, the same model can exhibit negative relationships between nestedness and biodiversity when examined in a distinct, plausible region of parameter space. We discuss steps towards identifying when network structure could, on its own, drive the resilience, sustainability, and even conservation of ecological communities.

Soil Bacterial and Fungal Communities Show Distinct Recovery Patterns during Forest Ecosystem Restoration	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						bacteria; chronosequence; cooccurrence networks; disturbance; fungi; reclaimed mine soils; soil microbiota	MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; RAIN-FOREST; SUCCESSION; DIVERSITY; PLANT; CHRONOSEQUENCE; RESPONSES; DYNAMICS; MICROORGANISMS	Bacteria and fungi are important mediators of biogeochemical processes and play essential roles in the establishment of plant communities, which makes knowledge about their recovery after extreme disturbances valuable for understanding ecosystem development. However, broad ecological differences between bacterial and fungal organisms, such as growth rates, stress tolerance, and substrate utilization, suggest they could follow distinct trajectories and show contrasting dynamics during recovery. In this study, we analyzed both the intra-annual variability and decade-scale recovery of bacterial and fungal communities in a chro-nosequence of reclaimed mined soils using next-generation sequencing to quantify their abundance, richness, beta-diversity, taxonomic composition, and cooccurrence network properties. Bacterial communities shifted gradually, with overlapping beta-diversity patterns across chronosequence ages, while shifts in fungal communities were more distinct among different ages. In addition, the magnitude of intra-annual variability in bacterial beta-diversity was comparable to the changes across decades of chronosequence age, while fungal communities changed minimally across months. Finally, the complexity of bacterial cooccurrence networks increased with chronosequence age, while fungal networks did not show clear age-related trends. We hypothesize that these contrasting dynamics of bacteria and fungi in the chronosequence result from (i) higher growth rates for bacteria, leading to higher intra-annual variability; (ii) higher tolerance to environmental changes for fungi; and (iii) stronger influence of vegetation on fungal communities. IMPORTANCE Both bacteria and fungi play essential roles in ecosystem functions, and information about their recovery after extreme disturbances is important for understanding whole-ecosystem development. Given their many differences in phenotype, phylogeny, and life history, a comparison of different bacterial and fungal recovery patterns improves the understanding of how different components of the soil microbiota respond to ecosystem recovery. In this study, we highlight key differences between soil bacteria and fungi during the restoration of reclaimed mine soils in the form of long-term diversity patterns, intra-annual variability, and potential interaction networks. Cooccurrence networks revealed increasingly complex bacterial community interactions during recovery, in contrast to much simpler and more isolated fungal network patterns. This study compares bacterial and fungal cooccurrence networks and reveals cooccurrences persisting through successional ages.

Plant physical and chemical defenses can be extremely effective against young caterpillars, even of specialists. Phenological asynchrony with host plants can lead to dispersal and mortality in the early instars and increased predation or poor nutrition in later instars. Predation on early-instar larvae (including cannibalism) can be extremely high, parasitism appears generally low, and pathogens acquired early in larval development can lead to high mortality in later stadia. Four well-studied species reveal very different roles of early-instar mortality in population dynamics. In spruce budworm and gypsy moth, early-instar mortality rates can be very high; they do not drive outbreak cycles because density dependence is weak, but can modulate cycles and contribute to outbreak size and duration. For the autumnal moth, early-instar survival depends on host plant synchrony, but may or may not be density dependent. For monarch butterflies, the relative importance of larval mortality rates in population dynamics remains unclear. Tritrophic interactions between herbivores, host plants, natural enemies, and microbes play complex and species-specific roles in early-instar ecology, leading to emergent dynamics in population fluctuations. The phenology of these relationships is often poorly understood, making their responses to climate change unpredictable.

The aim of this study was to determine the mycorrhizal dependency of Arachis hypogea L. to different P levels and to evaluate the development of host and endophyte after colonization. A greenhouse experiment was carried out in completely randomized design, with two mycorrhizal fungi species (Gigaspora rosea and Glomus clarum) and a control without the fungus, and also with different P levels applied to the soil (0, 75, 150 and 250 mg kg(-1) of P). After 50 days of groundnuts germination, there were evaluated dry weight (DW), root colonization, number of spores in the soil, mycorrhizal dependency and available P. The peanut plants showed mycorrhizal dependency when inoculated with G. rosea in low supply of P and for G. clarum only in the absence of the nutrient. The inoculation with G. rosea produced higher DW with 75 mg kg(-1) of P (7.2 g per plant), whereas there was an increase in the accumulation of P in shoots up to the highest dose (250 mg kg(-1)) of P. Although G. clarum provided higher number of spores and root colonization ratio, it had the lowest plant growth and also lower P use efficiency by shoots.

However, this assumption has not been tested for bacteria. Here we investigate how abundance of soil bacteria relates to slow growth and substrate specialization (oligotrophy) vs. fast growth and substrate generalization (copiotrophy). We collected 47 saprotrophic soil bacterial isolates of differing abundances and measured their growth rate and the ability to use a variety of single carbon sources. Opposite to our expectation, there was no relationship between abundance in soil and the measured growth rate or substrate utilization profile (SUP). However, isolates with lower growth rates used fewer substrates than faster growing ones supporting the assumption that growth rate may relate to substrate specialization. Interestingly, growth rate and SUP were correlated with phylogeny, rather than with abundance in soil. Most markedly, Gammaproteobacteria on average grew significantly faster and were able to use more substrates than other bacterial classes, whereas Alphaproteobacteria were growing relatively slowly and used fewer substrates. This finding suggests that growth and substrate utilization are phylogenetically deeply conserved. We conclude that growth rate and substrate utilization of soil bacteria are not general determinants of their abundance. Future studies on explaining bacterial abundance need to determine how other factors, such as competition, predation and abiotic factors may contribute to rarity or abundance in soil bacteria.

(1) Fungal fruit rot should be generally deterrent to frugivores. But because fungi may vary in their negative effects, antifungal defenses should be allocated in relationship to net effects of particular species on dispersal. (2) Defenses of fruits under selection for high palatability should be directed primarily toward microbes (''microbe-specific'' defenses). Lower quality fruits, for which high palatability is not crucial to dispersal, may be defended by more general defenses. (3) Preferred fruits should be defended to a lower degree than less preferred fruits, as a result of consistently high dispersal rates (Removal Rate model). We tested our hypotheses using real fruits and artificial-pulp media of six temperate ericaceous plants in feeding trials with captive birds and in fungal growth trials. Plants had been assigned to two temperate fruiting classes (Summer Small-seeded, SS, or Fall Low-quality, FL), and differed in ripening phenology, persistence times, and fungal resistance in the field. We compared feeding rates on fruits rotted by members of a suite of fruit rot fungi. We also determined feeding rates on artificial-pulp media that either contained ripe fruit extracts or did not, and we determined fungal growth rates on identical media. We found that: (1) fungal species depressed feeding rates in general accordance with their reported vertebrate toxicity. Relative to nontoxic fungi, toxic fungi were inhibited more strongly by secondary fruit pulp extracts. (2) Artificial-pulp media of SS fruits were preferred in feeding trials, due both to basic nutritional composition and nondeterrent (microbe-specific) secondary defense. (3) In accordance with the Removal-Rate model, artificial-pulp media of the preferred SS fruits showed significant antifungal activity, but at a much lower level than that of FL fruits. Our results suggest that a primary function of secondary chemicals in ripe fruits may be to defend against destructive fungi that compete with seed dispersers for the pulp. Our results generally support the hypothesis that selective pressures may result in ripe fruit defenses that are directed primarily against organisms having strong negative effects upon dispersal. As such, factors influencing risk of pulp consumption by nondispersers may be useful predictors of fruit defense patterns.

For example, many grasses are inhabited by fungal endophytes that affect aspects of their host's physiology, morphology, and reproduction. However, there have not been any analyses of the potential effect of endophytes on the strength of phenotypic selection on quantitative traits. Here, a previously published data set on several life history traits measured for two years in a field population of 12-13 Lolium perenne genotypes, each replicated as symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants, was analyzed using the standard Lande-Arnold method of selection analysis. In one year, endophytic symbionts reduced the strength of selection on the number of reproductive tillers when relative fitness was expressed as seed yield. Also, symbionts selected for reduced tiller production when fitness was expressed as mean seed mass. These changes in the strength of selection only occurred when fitness of genotypes when symbiotic was unrelated to fitness of the same genotypes when non-symbiotic. In a second year, when fitness of symbiotic and non-symbiotic groups were significantly correlated, there was no detectable selection on reproductive tiller production. Because the effects of microbial endosymbionts were only shown for one year in a single host population, additional research is needed to better assess how endosymbionts might mediate selective pressures in other natural plant populations.

Aragorn' (Fabaceae), infected with two persistently transmitted viruses, Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) and Bean leaf roll virus (BLRV), that differ in their distribution within an infected plant. Aphids preferentially oriented toward and settled on plants infected with PEMV or BLRV in comparison with sham-inoculated plants (plants exposed to herbivory by uninfected aphids), but aphids did not discriminate between plants infected with the two viruses. Analysis of plant volatiles indicated that plants inoculated with either virus had significantly higher green leaf volatile-to-monoterpene ratios. Time until reproductive maturity was marginally influenced by plant infection status, with a trend toward earlier nymph production on infected plants. There were consistent age-specific effects of plant infection status on aphid fecundity: reproduction was significantly enhanced for aphids on BLRV-infected plants across most time intervals, though mean aphid fecundity did not differ between sham and PEMV-infected plants. There was no clear pattern of age-specific survivorship; however, mean aphid lifespan was reduced on plants infected with PEMV. Our results are consistent with predictions of the host manipulation hypothesis, extended to include plant viruses: non-viruliferous A.pisum preferentially orient to virus-infected host plants, potentially facilitating pathogen transmission. These studies extend the scope of the host manipulation hypothesis by demonstrating that divergent fitness effects on vectors arise relative to the mode of virus transmission.

In order to explore the bioactivity of nanochitin on tobacco, the effects of nanochitin suspensions on tobacco seed germination, seedling growth, and synergistic effects with fungicides were studied in indoor and field trials. Results showed that 0.004% (w/v) of nanochitin improved tobacco seed germination and shortened mean time to germination significantly; 0.005% (w/v) of nanochitin increased tobacco stem length, stem girth, leaf number and leaf area, and 0.001% (w/v) of nanochitin had synergistic effects on inhibition of tobacco root rot when mixed with metalaxyl mancozeb and thiophanate methyl fungicides. This indicates that nanochitin suspensions have a strong potential to protect tobacco from tobacco root rot diseases and reduce the use of chemical fungicides in tobacco plantations.

Sugar maple saplings and E. americanum plants were planted together in pots placed in the ground of a maple forest in 1999. Ectomycorrhizal yellow birches (Betula alleghaniensis) were added as control plants. In spring 2000, during leaf expansion of sugar maple saplings, the leaves of E. americanum were labelled with (CO2)-C-14. Seven days after labelling, radioactivity was detected in leaves, stem and roots of sugar maples. Specific radioactivity in sugar maples was 13-fold higher than in yellow birches revealing the occurrence of a direct transfer of C-14 between the AM plants. The quantity of C-14 transferred to sugar maple saplings was negatively correlated with the percentage of C-14 allocated to the storage organ of E. americanum. A second labelling was performed in autumn 2000 on sugar maple leaves during annual growth of E. americanum roots. Radioactivity was detected in 7 of 22 E. americanum root systems and absent in yellow birches. These results suggest that AM fungi connecting different understorey species can act as reciprocal C transfer bridges between plant species in relation with the phenology of the plants involved.

Plants of cotton (cvs. NuOpal and BRS Buriti) were grown in nutrient solution containing 0 (+Si) or 2 mM Si L-1 (-Si) and inoculated with a conidial suspension of R. areola at 30 days after emergence. The incubation period (IP), latent period (LP 60), severity, number of lesions (NL) per cm(2) of leaf area, lesion size (LS), foliar Si concentration and the activities of defense enzymes peroxidases (POX), polyphenoloxidases (PPO), chitinases (CHI), beta-1,3-glucanases (GLU), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyases (PAL) were evaluated. Data from severity were used to calculate the area under ramularia leaf spot progress curve (AURLSPC). Leaf Si concentration increased by 64% on plants supplied with Si compared to plants not supplied with this element. There were increases of 10 and 14.7% for IP and LP 60, respectively, on plants supplied with Si. Reductions of 38.6 and 62.4% for NL and 17.2 and 26.6% for LS occurred, respectively, for plants from NuOpal and BRS Buriti cvs supplied with Si. AURLSPC was reduced by 35% for the + Si treatment compared to the -Si treatment. The concentration of total soluble phenolic compounds on plants of both cv. supplied with Si increased during the progress of ramularia, but the lowest values occurred for the -Si treatment until 18 days after inoculation (dai). The increase on the concentration of lignin derivatives was significant only for plants of cv. BRS Buriti infected by R. areola and supplied with Si. POX activity was higher on plants from the two cultivars supplied with Si compared to plants not supplied with this element. For plants of cv. NuOpal supplied with Si, PPO, CHI, GLU, and PAL activities increased until 18 dai, but the activities of PAL and PPO on plants of cv. BRS Buriti were not potentiated by Si. On plants from cv. BRS Buriti supplied with Si, there was increase on CHI and GLU activities at 21 dai compared to plants not supplied with Si. It can be concluded that cotton resistance to ramularia leaf spot was biochemically enhanced by Si, especially for plants of cv. NuOpal considered susceptible to ramularia leaf spot.

Saprophagous insect larvae, Drosophila melanogaster, profit from increased species richness in beneficial microbes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Aspergillus nidulans; competition; insect-fungus interactions; species richness; yeast	FUNGAL SYMBIONTS; BACTERIA; PROTECT; MICROORGANISMS; COMPETITION; RESISTANCE; EVOLUTION; MUTUALISM; DISEASE; ANTS	Female fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, lay their eggs on decaying plant material. Foraging fly larvae strongly depend on the availability of dietary microbes, such as yeasts, to reach the adult stage. In contrast, strong interference competition with filamentous fungi can cause high mortality among Drosophila larvae. Given that many insects are known for employing beneficial microbes to combat antagonistic ones, we hypothesized that fly larvae engaged in competition with the noxious mould Aspergillus nidulans benefit from the presence of dietary yeast species, especially when they are associated with increasingly species rich yeast communities (ranging from one to six yeast species per community). On a nutrient-limited fruit substrate infested with A. nidulans, both larval survival and development time were positively affected by more diverse yeast communities. On a mould-free fruit substrate, merely larval development but not survival was found to be affected by increasing species richness of dietary yeasts. Not only yeast diversity had an effect on D. melanogaster life-history traits, but also the identity of the yeast combinations. These findings demonstrate the importance of the structure and diversity of microbial communities in mutualistic animal-microbe interactions.

Of the five predicted SPL genes encoded by the alfalfa genome, three (SPL6, SPL12 and SPL13) contain miR156 cleavage sites and their expression was down-regulated in transgenic alfalfa plants overexpressing miR156. These transgenic plants had reduced internode length and stem thickness, enhanced shoot branching, increased trichome density, a delay in flowering time and elevated biomass production. Minor effects on sugar, starch, lignin and cellulose contents were also observed. Moreover, transgenic alfalfa plants had increased root length, while nodulation was maintained. The multitude of traits affected by miR156 may be due to the network of genes regulated by the three target SPLs. Our results show that the miR156/SPL system has strong potential as a tool to substantially improve quality and yield traits in alfalfa.

The treatments consisting of NPK levels viz; 0:0:0 (T(0)) control or 10:30:10 (T(1)) and 20:60:20 (T(2)) kg/ha exhibited significant differences amongst the genotypes in nodulation. Genotypic response of rice bean (Vigna umbellate (Thunb) Ohwi and Ohashi) to Rhizobium spp. was studied in terms of nodule number and fresh weight (g) under different fertilizer treatments. Genotype IC-140796 was observed to have significantly high number of nodules and fresh weight (g), whereas, IC-137200 and JCR-107 had significantly lower number of nodules in comparison to the check (BRS-2). Fertilizer treatments significantly affected nodule number and weight. Crude fibre and total ash increased significantly in the fodder samples with increasing rates of N, P and K, whereas, crude protein content showed non-significant effects. Number and nodule weight showed significant positive of correlation between T(1) and control, whereas plant biomass and days to flowering showed significant positive between association T(2). Plant biomass showed positive correlation with crude fibre in T(2), whereas, crude protein and ash content had positive correlation in T(1) and T(2). Ash and nodule number showed positive association in control only. Among the three treatments under study, T(2) treatment with NPK ratio @ 20: 60:20 Kg ha (-1) was observed promising for nodulation and quality traits.

The progress of the research on these organisms is represented here as an exponential process and its history may be divided into three periods. In the beginning, Plant period (1576-1727), these organisms were interpreted as plants. The Animal period (1727-2007) brought in their consideration as animals and includes three phases that introduce new research approaches (phase 1: variability, microstructure, transplantation; phase 2: multiple skeletal characters, global spatial and temporal attention; phase 3: life history, molecular biology). Recently, the number of sources of scleractinian knowledge has increased to five: morphology, paleobiology, ecology, life history and molecular biology. Scleractinian corals are no longer considered alone but as holobionts, along with their symbiotic zooxanthallae and other associated microbiota. The accumulated multidisciplinary data and new integrative concepts urge a holistic interpretation and have been indicating (since 2007) the commencement of the present, Holistic period. This analysis of the current status of scleractinian knowledge provides a list of proposed directions for future research.

Endophyte distributions have been described at a variety of scales ranging from those at a landscape level to those at the finest scales of resolution within a single leaf or patch of bark. At a landscape level, distribution patterns seem to be determined by host specificity, liquid precipitation, canopy cover, and geographic continuity or disjunctness. At the level of the individual stand or tree, height in the crown may become important. At the level of individual branch systems, age of substrate appears the most important factor. At a microscopic scale, tissue specificity, leaf topography, and phenology of the infection process with respect to leaf development all play a role. Endophytic fungi have seldom been found to cause widespread disease in trees; furthermore, their age-specific infection frequencies in conifer needles show continuous increases with needle age, in contrast to needle pathogens in which infections are largely confined to young needles. Endophytes are usually viewed as protective mutualists acting against herbivorous insects and pathogenic fungi. Proof of mutualism requires not only that endophytes be present in tissues under attack and their presence be correlated with, for example, increased insect mortality, but that inoculation experiments and comparisons with uninoculated plant tissues also be done. Such experiments often show no differences between treatment and control plants, results that may be related to unsuccessful inoculation of the endophyte. Such results may also be rooted in an inability to reproduce the biological complexity present in natural forest stands. Multiple infections of single leaves may lead to synergistic interactions of toxins produced by endophytes. Insect herbivores have evolved behavioral responses to the presence of endophytes, and protective mutualism by endophytes may occur only intermittently.

Utilization of actinobacteria to enhance the production and quality of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruits in a semi-arid environment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Actinobacteria; Biofertilizer; Date palm; Metabolites; Biological activity	PLANT-GROWTH PROMOTION; AGRICULTURE; BACTERIA; ACID; STRATEGY; WATER; ASSAY; RISK; SPP.	Actinobacteria have received much attention due to their capacity for plant growth promotion, a promising approach in sustainable development of agriculture. Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is an important crop, particularly in semi-arid regions of the world, due to the high nutritional and health-promoting values of its fruits. The present study was conducted to investigate the utilization of actinobacteria as an approach to support soil fertility and enhance production and functional food value of date palm fruits in a semi-arid environment. To achieve this purpose, actinobacterial strains were isolated from palm rhizosphere, characterized and screened for bioactivity. Then the potent isolates, based on plant growth promoting assays, were inoculated into the soil rhizosphere of five-target palms (Ajwa, Sokary, Khodry, Rashodia and Saffawy) before flowering and during fruiting stages in two successive seasons. Interestingly, the actinobacterial inoculants increased soil fertility and improved fruit yield of the tested palms. The treated date fruits accumulated higher levels of valuable phytochemicals such as sugars, organic acids, essential amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, vitamins and minerals, as compared with the untreated ones. Moreover, actinobacterial treatment induced the biological activities (antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer) of the produce dates. Conclusively, results presented herein suggest the promising application of actinobacteria for supporting the production and functional food value of date palms in semi-arid regions.

Establishing small juvenile individuals and established, larger, sexually reproducing adult individuals represent two life-history stages within species. We investigated the nitrogen and carbon resource use of adult and juvenile individuals and similarity of symbiotic fungal community composition in these two plant life stages. We used the plant Solidago virgaurea growing in a simplified system in the low Arctic as model species. Methods Isotopic signatures (foliar delta N-15 and foliar delta C-13) were analysed to characterize nitrogen acquisition and water-use efficiency of the plants. Symbiotic root fungal community composition was estimated by cloning and sequencing small subunit ribosomal RNA gene. Important Findings The isotopic signatures differed significantly between the life stages, indicating that the establishing juvenile cohort used relatively more amino acids or gained N through mycorrhizal symbiosis in comparison to the established adult plants. Symbiotic fungal communities did not differ between the two plant cohorts suggesting a possibility that the plants shared the same mycorrhizal network. We conclude that competition-mediated differences in plant resource use may create niche differentiation between the two life-history stages and enable them to coexist.

The field experiment was conducted on an experimental area of Embrapa Cerrados, Planaltina, in the Federal District. Eight soil management systems with different implements and periods of crop residue incorporation were compared. Soil samples were collected from five layers: 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, and 30-40 cm, with three replicates and in three sampling periods: before corn planting, 30 days after germination and at corn flowering. Treatments under no-till differed from each other regarding the microbial biomass C-mic and N-mic contents: while in one no-till treatment the soil cultivated by moldboard plow in the first. year (PDAV) had a higher C-mic content, in the other no-till treatment the soil cultivated by dish plow in the first year (PDAD) had a higher N-mic content. This indicates that the effects in the soil profile caused by dish and moldboard plowing are still measurable, even after 22 years under no-till. In general, the greatest differences between no-till (PDAD and PDAV) or minimum tillage (chisel plow), and those with greater soil disturbance (dish and moldboard plow) were observed before planting, that is, before soil plowing and fertilization for the crop.

Seed samples of each population were inoculated with a spore suspension of cultures of Aspergillus spp. known to produce aflatoxins. Inoculated seeds were maintained at 85% RH in plastic boxes kept at room temperature. At 50% germination, seed samples were planted in the field. At flowering time, selected plants were bulk pollinated. After three cycles of selection, gains for tolerance to aflatoxin formation and improvement for agronomic characters were evaluated. The results indicate there are differences in aflatoxin accumulation between different genotypes and cycles of selection. Populations 22 (DMR) and 28 (DMR) were the most damaged and Population 31 DMR suffered the lowest infection. The study suggests that there are differences in aflatoxin production between the maize genotypes tested. However, our results failed to show that tolerance to aflatoxin development can be accumulated through a recurrent selection breeding scheme.

The fungus grows systemically, persists indefinitely as an endophyte within the perennial host, and produces a stroma bearing conidia and ascospores at the time of host flowering. The ascospores or conidia are thought to infect plants through the cut ends of tillers after swathing at harvest. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of systemic fungicides and postharvest treatments (burning and reclipping) to reduce the rate of increase of choke disease among plants. The fungicides propiconazole and azoxystrobin reduced germination of conidia of E. typhina in vitro, but had no effect on development of stroma or viability of conidia produced on infected plants. In field tests, fungicides applied to the cut ends of tillers after harvest were ineffective at reducing the rate of increase in disease. Likewise, reclipping of orchardgrass stubble after harvest, in an attempt to remove incipient infections in the tillers, did not reduce the rate of disease increase in the stand. However, propane-assisted burning of postharvest stubble did reduce the polyetic epidemic rate to 2.7% per year, compared with approximately 9.2% per year in plots receiving the fungicide, reclipping, or control treatments. The results suggest that postharvest burning may be useful in controlling choke disease and raise the possibility that there are infection courts other than the pith of cut reproductive tillers.

J	773		Rohlfs, M				Rohlfs, M			Genetic variation and the role of insect life history traits in the ability of Drosophila larvae to develop in the presence of a competing filamentous fungus	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						genetic variation; heritability differences; insect-mould interaction; inter-kingdom competition; life history; survival	INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; QUANTITATIVE VARIATION; FAMILIAR ENVIRONMENTS; STRESS RESISTANCE; TRADE-OFFS; EVOLUTION; MELANOGASTER; DENSITY; POPULATIONS	Competitive interactions between organisms from distantly related phylogenetical branches have been suggested as being one of the most pervasive forms of interspecific competition. However, so-called inter-kingdom competition has rarely been the focus of ecological and evolutionary studies. Thus, a relatively novel hypothesis has been proposed on the basis that saprophagous insects might intensively compete with filamentous fungi for ephemeral resources (e.g. decaying plant tissue). Consideration that life history traits (e.g. developmental time) are adaptive in determining developmental success in the presence of con- or hetero-specifics competitors implies that these traits have been progressively established by natural selection. Because a similar scenario may apply to antagonistic interactions between saprophagous insects and filamentous fungi, one can expect the existence of heritable variation in developmental success when insect larvae are forced to grow in the presence of noxious mould. Therefore, this study aimed at discovering whether a local population of Drosophila melanogaster indeed harbours genetic variation in developmental success in the presence of the mould Aspergillus niger. By using the isofemale line technique, single larvae forced to feed on fungal infected or uninfected substrate were analysed for variation in survival probability to the adult stage, developmental time and body size of emerged adults. I found genetic variation in survival probability in fungal infected substrates but not in uninfected larval food sources. Mean developmental time and body size varied significantly among isofemale lines in both types of larval environment. Survival was negatively correlated with developmental time on fungal infected substrate, but variation in developmental time on fungal-free substrates was not correlated with survival on fungal infected food patches. Within-trait correlation between fungal infected and uninfected substrates was surprisingly weak, and developmental time was not correlated with body size. The results of this study demonstrate (a) the existence of genetic variation for larval developmental success in the presence of A. niger in a Drosophila population, and (b) heritability of important insect life history traits differed as a function of the larval environment (fungal infected or uninfected feeding substrate). I discuss models that might explain heritability differences and the evolutionary consequences of these results.

Density-dependent disease, life-history trade-offs, and the effect of leaf pathogens on a suite of co-occurring close relatives	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						coexistence; leaf economic spectrum; life-history trade-offs; medicago; plant-pathogen interactions; stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms; trifolium	RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; NATURAL ENEMIES; PLANT DIVERSITY; TROPICAL TREE; HOST DENSITY; FUNGAL; HERBIVORES; TOLERANCE; RELEASE	1. Plant pathogens reduce the performance of their hosts and therefore may contribute to ecological mechanisms of coexistence. In Chesson's framework, pathogens contribute to stabilizing mechanisms when they intensify negative intraspecific interactions, such as density-dependent disease. Additionally, pathogens contribute to equalizing mechanisms when they reduce differences in performance among species. Life-history trade-offs predict higher susceptibility to pathogens in rapidly growing species, which could equalize performance among fast- and slow-growing species in the presence of pathogens. 2. In a coastal prairie in California, we studied the impact of leaf diseases on the performance of 17 co-occurring species of Trifolium and Medicago (clovers). We transplanted clovers in randomized arrays into the natural prairie community in 3 years of common garden experiments. We quantified infection rates by isolating fungi from leaves, and we measured disease severity as per cent leaf area damaged. In a fungicide experiment, we measured the impact of infection on biomass and survival. We assessed whether disease on transplants was positively related to natural abundance of that species in the surrounding community, which we monitored over 5 years. We assessed life-history trade-offs by testing whether more rapidly growing species were more susceptible to pathogens. 3. Rank abundance of clover species was stable over 5 years despite marked environmental fluctuations. Across hosts, fungal infection was not linearly related to density, although transplants of species that were locally absent showed lower and more variable infection. Disease severity was greater for more abundant species, but in only 1 of 3 years, and response to fungicide was not stronger in more abundant species. As predicted by life-history trade-offs, faster-growing species experienced greater fungal infection. However, the impact of that infection was less negative, not more negative, on faster-growing species. 4. Our results suggest that life-history trade-offs in plant-pathogen interactions may influence equalizing mechanisms among species in this guild, but the combined effects of greater infection with greater tolerance may limit rather than promote coexistence. We also found modest evidence that density-dependent disease may contribute to stabilizing mechanisms. Lack of host specificity, rapid evolution of host use and temporal variation in climatic conditions may all influence the role that pathogens play in coexistence of these closely related plants.

The characterization study comprised 51 qualitative and 50 quantitative characters. Quantitative parameters were analyzed by Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The 2-dimensional plot (49.3% of cumulative variability) formed a main group of accessions and 4 outliers (#1, #9, #27 and #28) separated in the first PC. The characters with a higher contribution to the first PC were inflorescence length, leaf petiole length and leaf central foliole area. The presence of alkaloids, the percentage of plants killed by soil borne fungal diseases, the phenology, the yield per plant and yield components were also assessed. Twenty six accessions (the main group in the PCA plot) showed high homogeneity, with the following highlights: bitterness, indeterminate growth habit, early ripeness and spring sowing with the exception of #18, in which seeding date is unknown and it had a later phenology. By contrast accessions #9 and #27 were bitter of autumn sowing with determinate growing habit and they had the longest values of primary inflorescence length and a later phenology when they were sown in spring. Average values for yield and yield components showed a broad range of variation between accessions. The main yield component was the number of pods per plant. Accession #22 had the highest mean seed mass, although this had not significant influence in yield. Accession #17 showed the highest yield and #1 the lowest. This last also had the lowest values of inflorescence length, leaf petiole length and leaf central foliole area. No significant differences of resistance to soil-borne fungi were found between accessions. The year had a significant effect in the phenology, yield and yield components except for number of seeds per pod. The studied material might be of interest for the development of spring sowing germplasm adapted to north Iberian peninsula.

Its cause has been attributed to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. However, its symptoms in leaves have not been reproduced. In this study we reported for the first time the presence of X. fastidiosa, causal agent of the coffee atrophy in petiole and hypocotyls from coffee plants with buttery spot through PCR and ultrastructural studies by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In this study three trials were developed. In the first we collected leaves from plant with and without buttery spot symptoms in two places which were prepared for SEM. In the second petioles of 40 symptomatic and 40 asymptomatic leaves were collected in a coffee experimental field of Federal University of Lavras. Petiole from these leaves were cut and macerated for DNA extraction and analyzed by PCR. Four petioles of each sample (plants with and without symptoms) were prepared for SEM. In a third trial, seeds from plants with battery spot were sowed in foam trays with Plantimax (R) substrate. The trays stayed in a growth chamber and after 30,60 and 90 days of the germination hypocotyls were collected for preparation and observation in SEM. Initially a bacterium similar to X fastidiosa was found in vessels of symptomatic plants studied. Through the analysis by PCR we verified X. fastidiosa in 34% of plants with the disease symptoms and 9,3% in those without symptom of buttery spot. Petioles of positives Xylella plants by PCR presented obstruction of vessels of xylem by bacteria. Out of four PCR-negatives plants, one had petioles with vessels clogged by bacteria when analyzed by SEM. In analyzed hypocotyls with SEM were observed bacterial cells like X. fastidiosa in xylem vessels at 60 and 90 days. This is the first report of the colonization of X. fastidiosa in coffee plant petiole and hypocotyls of seeds of plants expressed buttery spot symptoms.

Most of the empirical evidence on the relationships between the yield of small grain cereal crops and its contributing traits has been obtained under dry or semidry conditions. The aims of this paper were to (1) illustrate how an path analysis can be used to clarify and interpret the relationships between grain yield (GY), yield components, and other yield-related traits of 25 winter wheat cultivars subjected to sources of environmental variation and (2) determine how the yield-related traits contribute to the yield variation. The data used in this analysis were generated from multi-environment trials across wheat-growing areas in Poland. Using Ward's clustering procedure was capable of identifying the most critical predictor traits of the yield components and their contributions to cultivar-focused GY variation. Our findings document, confirm, and improve the basic biological understanding of how to grow modern wheat cultivars for high GY through effectively stimulating the improvement of yield-related traits through the optimization of developmental stage-based agronomic strategies. Our results confirmed empirically that modern European wheat cultivars grown in a temperate climate require favorable conditions, the use of appropriate N fertilizer and growth regulators, and the application of fungicide to protect against leaf diseases and to provide conditions that effectively increase the time to anthesis, the Leaf Area Index per spike at anthesis, and the grain filling duration, and reduce plant height and flag leaf disease severity, thus leading to a high GY. A high yield level is obtained by the performance of preferred yield-related traits that can maintain the three yield components at relatively high levels.

The purpose of this study was to assess the behaviour of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during the manufacturing and ripening of this raw goat milk cheese. Raw milk was experimentally inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 in a laboratory scale plant and the count was monitored during production and 30 days of ripening required for this cheese. Results showed that E. coli O157:H7 count increased to more than 1.5 Log cfu g(-1) during cheese production and remained constant until the end of ripening. The evidence that E. coli O157:H7 is able to survive during the manufacturing and ripening process suggests that the 30-day ripening period alone is insufficient to eliminate levels of viable E. coli O157:H7 in Formaggelle di capra cheese and that the presence of low numbers of E. coli O157:H7 in milk destined for the production of raw goat milk cheeses could represent a potential source of infection for humans and a threat for consumers.

J	779		Vargas, R; Kenney, AM; Bilinski, T				Vargas, Rhiannon; Kenney, Amanda M.; Bilinski, Teresa			Variable Influences of Water Availability and Rhizobacteria on the Growth of Schizachyrium scoparium (Little Bluestem) at Different Ages	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						PGPR; native grassland species; environmental stress; water limitation; rhizosphere manipulation; rhizosphere microbes	DROUGHT STRESS TOLERANCE; LEAF LEVEL PHYSIOLOGY; PLANT-GROWTH; PROMOTING RHIZOBACTERIA; ROOT EXUDATION; ACC DEAMINASE; RHIZOSPHERE MICROBIOME; SOIL; BACTERIA; RESISTANCE	There is significant interest in understanding the role of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in alleviating different types of plant stress. Schizachyrium scoparium (little bluestem) is a moderately drought tolerant, perennial bunchgrass native to North America. The goal of this experiment was to evaluate whether the addition of a bacterial root isolate in the Pseudomonas genus promoted the growth of S. scoparium with changes in water availability. Pseudomonas are common rhizobacteria and have been shown to improve plant growth. It was hypothesized that plants inoculated with the PGPR strain would have greater growth and health, and would be less affected by shifts in water availability. Pseudomonas strains were isolated from the roots of native S. scoparium plants. After germination, S. scoparium seedlings were subjected to four treatment groups: low water; high water; low water with PGPR; and high water with PGPR. The experiment was run three times with plants at different starting ages; 14-, 28-, and 70-day-old plants. The effects of the water and PGPR treatments were variable between the experimental trials. There were no significant effects of the water treatments on plant growth in Trial 1 (14-day-old plants) or Trial 2 (28-day-old plants), however, there was a significant negative effect of the high watering treatment on the shoot length and biomass in Trial 3. High water availability was significantly associated with greater plant health in Trial 1, but appeared to reduce plant health in Trials 2 and 3. The PGPR treatment appeared to promote root growth and biomass in Trial 2, and was associated with greater plant health in all three trials, especially when paired with the low water treatment. Results from a permutational MANOVA indicate that plant growth was significantly different between the trials due to differences in the starting age of the plants and the duration of the experiments. Thus, methodological choices, such as plant life history stage and experiment duration, may affect the response of plants to PGPR in the rhizosphere. This research provides an insight into the interactions between PGPR and water availability on the growth and health of native plants.

In dioecious plants, female and male individuals have different resource demands and allocation patterns. As a consequence of these differences, it is logical to assume that female and male plants differ in their relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, although this has rarely been examined. We used a factorial greenhouse experiment to investigate whether female and male plants in the dioecious model species Antennaria dioica have a different relationship with their AM symbionts under two soil pH levels. In particular, we asked: (1) Do the sexes in A. dioica have sex-specific benefits from AM symbiosis? (2) If so, which sex gains the highest benefit? (3) How does soil pH affect the sex - AM fungal relationship? Our results indicate that the sexes responded similarly to AM symbiosis and pH when mycorrhizal benefit was examined as growth and phosphorus accumulation. However, the sexes differed in response to AM symbiosis in terms of survival, as mortality was increased due to AM symbiosis in female plants whilst the opposite effect was detected in males. The plant-AM fungus relationship was significantly affected by soil pH as lowering the soil pH decreased the benefits gained by the plants from the mycorrhizal fungus. Taken together, our findings indicate that AM symbiosis is beneficial for plants depending on the life history trait considered. In addition, interactions between plants and their AM symbionts are modified by soil factors and the sex of the plant. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study has been to evaluate the effects of applying fungicides to maize seeds to increase the survival of seedlings and to enhance the early vigor and grain yield of the plants. The protective effects of 2-way (fludioxonil, metalaxil-M) and four-way (fludioxonil, metalaxil-M, azoxystrobin, thiabendazole) fungicide seed treatments were compared with an F. verticillioides seed infected control in 11 field trials carried out in North Italy. A second study focused on the impact F. verticillioides and F. graminearum seed-borne infection on plant growth and on the possible advantages of applying the previously reported seed dressing. The seed dressing increased the plant density, vigor during the whole vegetative growth cycle for all the production situations, and grain yield. F. verticillioides led to a higher seedling mortality than F. graminearum, while both species reduced plant growth and delayed the flowering date. Seed-borne infection has an important impact on both the population and vigor of maize plants. The four-way fungicide enhanced both the defense of the seedlings and the vigor of F. verticillioides infected plants, which in turn resulted in a significant improvement in grain yield, compared to a conventional two-way fungicide.

The purpose of this work was to study the influence of sever al manufacturing conditions (viz. mixture of ovine and caprine milks, source of coagulant, level of NaCl addition, and duration of ripening period) on the final characteristics of this cheese following a (replicated) factorial design. Milk type proved to be a statistically significant technological parameter in terms of numbers of viable microorganisms of various genera and the extent of proteolysis, probably as a consequence of higher initial contamination of caprine milk. The type of coagulant had a major effect on proteolysis: values of water-soluble nitrogen for cheeses coagulated with animal rennet were in general lower than those for cheeses coagulated with plant rennet, but much smaller differences were detected between values of non-protein nitrogen; and breakdown of alpha(s)- and beta-caseins was more extensive in Picante cheeses manufactured with plant rennet. The level of NaCl was a statistically significant parameter for all microbiological, physicochemical and chemical characteristics measured an observation that is probably due to its capacity to reduce water activity. Ripening time did not have a significant effect on the numbers of viable staphylococci. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited.

Such theories made implicit assumptions about the moss parasites, although very little of their life history was known. This is the first in a series of studies to elucidate the life history of the moss parasites. Polyspore monokaryotic cultures were obtained from basidiospores, and dikaryotic cultures were obtained from hyphae inside the moss host plant. In culture, the moss parasites produced Sporothrix-like anamorphs. The uninucleate conidia germinated by a germ tube, by production of single secondary conidia, or by iterative germination. Conidial-hyphal fusion was observed. A dikaryon was produced by mating single conidial isolates of Eocronartium muscicola, completing a part of its life history. Ultrastructural characteristics of wall break at branching, condensed chromatin during interphase, and simple septal pore morphology from fruiting bodies of Jola spp. and cultured isolates of Jola javensis and E. muscicola were consistent with those of related auricularioid phytoparasitic taxa, the rust fungi, and Pachnocybe ferruginea. Jola and Eocronartium can be grown in axenic culture and are not obligate parasites. In nature, the Sporothrix-like anamorph of these fungi may function in dispersal and mating. The previously unknown anamorph of the moss parasites may be instrumental in our understanding of the origin and evolution of the rust uredinial stage.

Six cheese-making trials were performed in a pilot plant by using pasteurized whole milk inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes (strain L2 [serotype 1/2a], L39, or L41 [serotype 4b]) to ca. 2.7 log CFU/ml. A starter containing three strains, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis IPLA 947, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis IPLA 838, and Leuconostoc citreum IPLA 616, grown separately in milk and combined in the volumetric proportion 3:1:1.3 was used. During the acidification L. monocytogenes counts increased 2.78- to 7.03-fold, depending on the strain, and remained within the curd; from this time counts decreased abruptly and were not detected in cheeses beyond the 7th day. The average pH in the curd was 4.43, and it decreased to around 4.0 in 5- to 7-day-old cheeses. These pH values were near the tolerance limit for L. monocytogenes and probably caused cell damage. Although moisture, a(w), and NaCl levels were not limiting for the growth and survival of L. monocytogenes, salt content must be considered as a contributing factor in L. monocytogenes inactivation. Finally, the L2 strain grew better in curd and was slightly more resistant to low pH and refrigeration than strain L39 or L41. The manufacture of Afuega'l Pitu cheese from pasteurized milk and the design of a specific starter from the autochthonous lactic microbiota can lead to a safer product that can be consumed after very short ripening periods.

Understanding how cultivated plants, their associated community members (including pest insects, natural enemies, soil microbes), and their interactions respond to warming to influence crop yields is critical to current and future food security. We conducted a two-year field study on the effects of elevated temperature on winter wheat growth and grain quality, insect pests, natural enemies, ground arthropods, weeds, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). RESULTSElevated temperature shortened the period of wheat growth, decreased grain yield, and reduced grain quality by increasing fiber and decreasing wet gluten, protein, total soluble sugars, and starch. Elevated temperature also increased aphid abundance while decreasing AMF colonization rates. Structural equation modeling indicated that the direct negative effect of warming on wheat yield was augmented by indirect negative effects via increased aphid and weed abundances along with decreased AMF colonization. CONCLUSIONClimate change can potentially affect crop production and quality both directly and indirectly by modifying interactions with aboveground and belowground organisms. Future studies on the effects of climate change on crops should consider the responses of aboveground and belowground biotic community members and their interactions with crop plants.

In the absence of relevant data in wheat kernels, we here examined the response of the different members of the XI protein population to infection with a Delta Tri5 mutant of Fusarium graminearum, the wild type of which is one of the most important wheat ear pathogens, in early developing wheat grain. Wheat ears were inoculated at anthesis, analyzed using 2-D DICE and multivariate analysis at 5, 15, and 25 days post anthesis (DPA), and compared with control samples. Distinct abundance patterns could be distinguished for different XI forms in response to infection with F. graminearum Delta Tri5. Some (iso)forms were up-regulated, whereas others were down-regulated. This pathogen-specific regulation of proteins was mostly visible at five DPA and levelled off in the samples situated further from the inoculation point. Furthermore, it was shown that most identified TAXI- and XIP-type XI (iso)forms significantly increased in abundance from the milky (15 DPA) to the soft dough stages (25 DPA) on a per kernel basis, although the extent of increase differed greatly. Non-glycosylated XIP forms increased more strongly than their glycosylated counterparts.

O. flexuosum seeds were inoculated with ten mycorrhizal isolates, originally obtained from the mycorrhiza of ten neotropical Brazilian orchid species, including O. flexuosum. One of the isolates belongs to Epulorhiza repens, two to Epulorhiza epiphytica, six to Ceratorhiza spp., and one to Rhizoctonia sp. Seeds inoculated with the M2 isolate of Ceratorhiza sp., originally isolated from the root system of wild O. flexuosum, promoted seed germination within 7 days and about 30% of the seedlings produced leaves after 50 days of incubation, all of which presented pelotons in some protocorm and rhizoid cells. The other isolates stimulated seed germination, although they did not lead to an ideal protocorm development. Seeds incubated in the absence of the mycorrhizal fungi failed to germinate.

Aspects of the specificity, anatomy of the plant-fungus interaction and the importance of the fungal strain selection prior to the use of mycorrhizal fungi for the symbiotical O. flexuosum cultivation from seeds are discussed.

Mobilizing the community of biodiversity specimen collectors to effectively detect and document outliers in the Anthropocene	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Anthropocene; biodiversity research collections; biological invasions; digitization; global change biology; herbaria; natural history collections; outliers; phenology; text mining	RAPID EVOLUTION; MONITOR	Premise Biological outliers (observations that fall outside of a previously understood norm, e.g., in phenology or distribution) may indicate early stages of a transformative change that merits immediate attention. Collectors of biodiversity specimens such as plants, fungi, and animals are on the front lines of discovering outliers, yet the role collectors currently play in providing such data is unclear. Methods We surveyed 222 collectors of a broad range of taxa, searched 47 training materials, and explored the use of 170 outlier terms in 75 million specimen records to determine the current state of outlier detection and documentation in this community. Results Collectors reported observing outliers (e.g., about 80% of respondents observed morphological and distributional outliers at least occasionally). However, relatively few specimen records include outlier terms, and imprecision in their use and handling in data records complicates data discovery by stakeholders. This current state appears to be at least partly due to the absence of protocols: only one of the training materials addressed documenting and reporting outliers. Conclusions We suggest next steps to mobilize this largely untapped, yet ideally suited, community for early detection of biotic change in the Anthropocene, including community activities for building relevant best practices.

The smut fungus is characterized by a dimorphic life cycle with a haploid saprophytic yeast-like stage and a dikaryotic plant-parasitic stage, which bears the teliospores as dispersal agents. In this study, seedlings and flowers of Silene latifolia Poir. (Caryophyllaceae) were inoculated with teliospores or sporidial cells of Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae (DC. ex Liro) G. Deml & Oberw. and the germination of teliospores, the infection process, and the proliferation in the host tissue were documented in vivo using light and electron microscopy. Although germination of the teliospore is crucial for the establishment of Microbotryum, basidium development is variable under natural conditions. In flowers, where the amount of nutrients is thought to be high, the fungus propagates as sporidia, and mating of compatible cells takes place only when flowers are withering and nutrients are decreasing. On cotyledons (i.e., nutrient-depleted conditions), conjugation occurs shortly after teliospore germination, often via intrapromycelial mating. After formation of an infectious hypha with an appressorium, the invasion of the host occurs by direct penetration of the epidermis. While the growth in the plant is typically intercellular, long distance proliferation seems mediated through xylem tracheary elements. At the beginning of the vegetation period, fungal cells were found between meristematic shoot host cells, indicating a dormant phase inside the plant. By using different microscopy techniques, many life stages of Microbotryum are illustrated for the first time, thereby allowing new interpretations of laboratory data.

Since the 1950s, researchers have combined first principles and data to predict the optimal timing of life history transitions. Recently, a striking mystery has emerged. Such transitions can be shaped by a completely different branch of the tree of life: species in the microbiome. Probing these interactions using testable predictions from evolutionary theory could illuminate whether and how host-microbiome integrated life histories can evolve and be maintained. Beyond advancing fundamental science, this research program could yield important applications. In an age of microbiome engineering, understanding the contexts that lead to microbiota signaling shaping ontogeny could offer novel mechanisms for manipulations to increase yield in agriculture by manipulating plant responses to stressful environments, or to reduce pathogen transmission by affecting vector efficiency. We combine theory and evidence to illuminate the essential questions underlying the existence of microbiome-dependent ontogenetic timing (MiDOT) to fuel research on this emerging topic.	[Metcalf, C.

Aphid honeydew-induced changes in soil biota can cascade up to tree crown architecture	PEDOBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Plant-soil interactions; Plant-herbivore interactions; Soil fauna; Earthworms; Tuberolachnus salignus; Willow	TUBEROLACHNUS-SALIGNUS GMELIN; SCALE INSECT HONEYDEW; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; LITTER DECOMPOSITION; HOST-PLANT; NITROGEN; EARTHWORMS; COLLEMBOLA; CARBON; OWEN	It has been hypothesised that aphid honeydew could alleviate the feeding damage by aphids via changes in soil biota leading to increased nutrient cycling and plant nutrient availability. However, to date, the evidence is equivocal. We used a field experiment with willow saplings to investigate the effect of aphid honeydew on trees with and without simulated honeydew deposition. Specifically, here we tested whether: (I) honeydew deposition can trigger changes in soil biota community composition, and (2) honeydew-induced changes in soil biota cascade up to affect plant performance and resource allocation. Honeydew deposition significantly increased microbial biomass and respiration, microfauna densities, earthworm biomass and litter mineralisation kinetics, while having detrimental effects on Collembola and mites. Honeydew deposition also increased the tree shoot to root biomass ratio and altered the crown canopy architecture and flowering phenology. However, no effects on leaf nitrogen content and tree shoot or root biomass were found. This was likely due to increased microbial nutrient immobilisation under the honeydew treatment. Path analyses present supporting evidence that the honeydew-induced changes in soil biota (notably via a pathway from microbial biomass to endogenic earthworms), can cascade up to affect tree resource allocation and crown architecture.

A split-plot randomized design was used with six replications and six treatments: Opera : 400, 500, 600 and 700 mL.ha(-1)commercial witness (800 mL.ha(-1) of Onyx : Carbendazim + propiconazole) and an untreated witness. The experimental units consisted of plastic pots opaque to light, filled with 8 kg of fertilized sandy loam soil (kg.ha(-1):120 N, 50 P2O,, 40 K2O) disinfected with Basamid((R)). In each plot, four seeds of maize, hybrid H2020 were planted, and four days after emergence the seedlings were thinned selectively to leave one healthy plant per container. A single application of each fungicide rate was performed 18 days after planting (V4). When plants were 25 days old (V6), the following morphometric and physiological variables were measured: total leaf area (LAT: cm(2)) number of leaves per plant (LNPP), dry biomass of the aerial part (DBAP: mg) and root dry biomass (RDB: mg), relative chlorophyll content (SPAD) and photosynthetic rate (PR: mu mol CO2 m(-2) s-1). Results indicated that maize plants treated with Opera((R)), had higher values for all tested variables as compared to the untreated and the commercial witness. Results suggest that Opera stimulates the physiology of the maize plant.	[Lazo, J.

The results showed increased induction of all the defense-related enzymes in mango fruits 3-5 days after dipping treatment with combination of bacterial antagonists and hexanal when compared to untreated control treatment and treatment with fungicide carbendazim in storage condition. The increased activity was observed up to 3 days after treatment and thereafter declined. Further, increased expression of specific isoforms of PO, PPO, SOD and CAT were also observed in the treatment effect of P. fluorescens (0.5%) + hexanal (0.02%) treated fruits against L. theobromae. From the results obtained, it is inferred that due to the enhancement of defense-related enzymes via the phenylpropanoid pathway and due to secretion of secondary metabolites that would play significant role in hindering the pathogen quiescence and further invasion in mango fruits and thereby prevent the fruit rot.

Effect of Rainfall-Induced Soil Geochemistry Dynamics on Grassland Soil Microbial Communities	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							NITROGEN LIMITATION; DIVERSITY; CARBON; RESPONSES; BIOMASS; WATER; MICROORGANISMS; VARIABILITY; COMPETITION; PLANTS	In Mediterranean-type grassland ecosystems, the timing of rainfall events controls biogeochemical cycles, as well as the phenology and productivity of plants and animals. Here, we investigate the effect of short-term (days) soil environmental conditions on microbial community structure and composition during a natural wetting and drying cycle. Soil samples were collected from a meadow in Northern California at four time points after the first two rainfall events of the rainy season. We used 16S rRNA microarrays (PhyloChip) to track changes in bacterial and archaeal community composition. Microbial communities at time points 1 and 3 were significantly different than communities at time points 2 and 4. Based on ordination analysis, the available carbon, soil moisture, and temperature explained most of the variation in community structure. For the first time, a complementary and more comprehensive approach using linear regression and generalized logical networks were used to identify linear and nonlinear associations among environmental variables and with the relative abundance of subfamilies. Changes in soil moisture and available carbon were correlated with the relative abundance of many phyla. Only the phylum Actinobacteria showed a lineage-specific relationship to soil moisture but not to carbon or nitrogen. The results indicate that the use of a high taxonomic rank in correlations with nutritional indicators might obscure divergent subfamily-level responses to environmental parameters. An important implication of this research is that there is short-term variation in microbial community composition driven in part by rainfall fluctuation that may not be evident in long-term studies with coarser time resolution.

Carbon Costs of Constitutive and Expressed Resistance to a Non-Native Pathogen in Limber Pine	PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENE-MEDIATED RESISTANCE; BLISTER RUST; WHITE-PINE; DISEASE RESISTANCE; FITNESS COSTS; GROWTH; CONSEQUENCES; COEVOLUTION; METABOLISM; INFECTION	Increasing the frequency of resistance to the non-native fungus Cronartium ribicola (causative agent of white pine blister rust, WPBR) in limber pine populations is a primary management objective to sustain high-elevation forest communities. However, it is not known to what extent genetic disease resistance is costly to plant growth or carbon economy. In this study, we measured growth and leaf-level physiology in (1) seedling families from seed trees that have previously been inferred to carry or not carry Cr4, the dominant R gene allele conferring complete, gene-for-gene resistance to WPBR in limber pine, and (2) populations that were and were not infected with C. ribicola. We found that, in the absence of C. ribicola exposure, there was no significant difference in carbon relations between families born from seed trees that harbor the resistance allele compared to those that lack it, either to plant growth and phenology or leaf-level photosynthetic traits. However, post-infection with C. ribicola, growth was significantly reduced in inoculation survivors expressing complete resistance compared to uninoculated seedlings. Furthermore, inoculation survivors exhibited significant increases in a suite of traits including photosynthetic rate, respiration rate, leaf N, and stomatal conductance and a decrease in photosynthetic water-use efficiency. The lack of constitutive carbon costs associated with Cr4 resistance in non-stressed limber pine is consistent with a previous report that the R gene allele is not under selection in the absence of C. ribicola and suggests that host resistance may not bear a constitutive cost in pathosystems that have not coevolved. However, under challenge by C. ribicola, complete resistance to WPBR in limber pine has a significant cost to plant growth, though enhanced carbon acquisition post-infection may offset this somewhat. These costs and effects on performance further complicate predictions of this species' response in warmer future climates in the presence of WPBR.

After epidemics in the USA during the 1990s, a resistance-breeding effort was undertaken focusing initially on the transfer of Type H resistance from unadapted Chinese cultivars. The objective of this study was to determine the magnitude and heritability of resistance in populations derived from adapted parents. Three soft red winter (SRW) wheat populations of 40 families each were artificially inoculated with Fusarium graminearum under mist irrigation in 2003 and 2004 at Lexington and Princeton, KY. Traits measured included anthesis date, plant height, disease severity, Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) and deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration. Broad sense heritability (BSH) estimates were generated from entry means over the four environments. Heritability of severity was approximately 0.30 in all populations; heritability of FDK ranged from 0.16 to 0.20. In 2003, a selection intensity of 20% was imposed on all populations, and the eight lowest severity families were advanced and evaluated at Lexington and Princeton in 2004. Direct selection response, averaged over both locations, ranged from 1.9 to 4.1% reduction in severity. Correlated reduction in FDK ranged from 0.4 to 6.5%; there was also a correlated increase in plant height of 1.7 to 4.1 cm after one cycle of selection. Progress in FHB resistance breeding in the absence of major QTL is likely to be constrained by low heritability and genotype X environment (G X E) interaction.

The objective of this study was to identify FHB resistance QTLs of the Brazilian spring wheat cultivar Frontana through molecular mapping. Frontana has small and medium effective QTLs. These types of QTLs are sensitive for the environmental factors and for the problems of heterogeneity. 206 DH lines from Frontana/Remus (IFA-Tulln) /2005-2006/ and 105 DH lines of Mini Mano/Frontana (CRC Szeged) /2006-2007/ were inoculated with isolates of F. graminearum and F culmorum. The Frontana/Remus DH population had wide differences in flowering time and plant height. MM/Frontana was created by CRC, Szeged so that too early and late DH lines were discarded and the remaining lines flowered within five days. Lines with extra plant height were also discarded, so differences were kept within 20-30 cm. In the Frontana/Remus population QTLs were identified on the chromosomes 3B, 5A, 6B. In the MM/Frontana Population chromosomes 3B and 5B gave positive signal. Although in both populations Frontana was the resistant parent no QTL markers were identical for them. It seems that the more homogeneous population increases the accuracy of the QTL analysis. An increased morphological homogeneity seems to be necessary to decrease background noise in QTL analyses and increase precision. Until now no QTL were found that gave positive signs for all epidemic situations. As QTLs are not validated, it is early to apply MAS in breeding.

Today, more than 300 million of the population is known to suffer from one or other allergic ailments affecting the socio-economic quality of life. Major causative agents implicated are pollen grains, fungal spores, dust mites, insect debris, animal epithelia, etc. Several aerobiological studies have been conducted in different parts of the world to ascertain aerial concentration and seasonality of pollen grains and fungi. Especially from clinical point of view, it is important to know the details about the pollen season and pollen load in the atmosphere. The flowering time of higher plants are events that come periodically in each season, but the time of blooming may differ from year to year, in different geographic locations. Based on differences recorded in several years of observations in airborne pollen, pollen calendars are drawn as an aid to allergy diagnosis and management. This review article emphasises on various aerobiological parameters of environmental pollen from different parts of the world with special emphasis from India. The role of aerobiology in the diagnosis and management of allergic diseases is reviewed briefly in this article.

In the present study, the ability of BRF-1 to control brown stem rot disease and to promote plant growth was examined using soybean plants grown in pots. Brown stem rot is a severe soil-borne disease of soybean that is caused by the pathogenic fungus Phialophora gregata. Eighteen-day-old soybean seedlings were grown in a mixture of soil (40 mL) and BRF-1 suspension (10 mL) and were dipped in a suspension of P. gregata (10(6) c.f.u. mL(-1)), and the severity of the disease was judged 62 days after the fungal inoculation. Inoculation with BRF-1 at 10(7) and 10(8) c.f.u. mL(-1) significantly lowered the severity of the disease. Soybean seeds incubated in 100 mL of the BRF-1 suspension (2 x 10(6) c.f.u. mL(-1)) were sown in pots filled with sand, and plants were collected 7 days after emergence. The dry weight increase in shoots and roots and mineral absorption were significantly stimulated by the inoculation. These results suggest that BRF-1 might be an effective biocontrol agent to manage brown stem rot disease in soybean. The 16S rDNA sequence of BRF-1 showed high homology with sequences of Paenibacillus polymyxa strains (e.g. 99.7% identity with P. polymyxa strain WY110).

Attempts to improve plant robustness and increase longevity have involved genetic modification, application of synthetic chemicals, and use of beneficial microbes. Recently, culture supernatant from a microalga Chlorella fusca was found to prime innate immunity against Pseudomonas syringae in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the capacity of Chlorella culture supernatants to prevent or delay aging in higher plants has not been elucidated. In this study, roots of the ornamental flowering plant Erinus alpinus L. were drenched with cell-free supernatants from three Chlorella species. Flower and leaf senescence in E. alpinus was significantly reduced and delayed with all three Chlorella supernatants. Investigations of the mode of action underlying delayed senescence showed that the Chlorella supernatants did not act as a chemical trigger to elicit plant immunity or as a growth-promoting fertilizer in E. alpinus. The mechanisms underlying the anti-aging effects remain undetermined, and several possible hypotheses are discussed. Several Chlorella species are industrially cultivated, and disposal of cell-free supernatant can be economically and environmentally challenging. This study provides a novel method for extending plant lifespan through use of Chlorella supernatant and discusses the potential of using industrial waste supernatants in agriculture and horticulture to reduce reliance on chemical pesticides and genetic modification.

Changes in a number of microbiological, chemical, and biochemical characteristics throughout ripening were followed in attempts to get scientific insight especially into the primary proteolysis brought about by this plant rennet in cheese. Using averages and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, it was concluded that the type of rennet had no significant effect on cheese composition (e.g., moisture, fat, protein, salt, and pH at the center and at the surface) over the ripening period but lower microbiological counts of Enterobacteria, Lactococci, and Lactobacilli were obtained for cheese manufactured with plant rennet until 28 days of the ripening. Conversely, several biochemical differences in cheese became apparent as ripening progressed. Electrophoretic analyses of the water insoluble fractions from cheeses manufactured with either rennet showed that beta-caseins were less susceptible to proteolysis than alpha(s)-caseins and that the animal rennet was more proteolytic on beta- and alpha(s)-caseins than the plant rennet; cheeses manufactured with the plant rennet exhibited higher levels of WSN/TN than cheeses manufactured with the animal rennet, although the former showed lower levels of TCA/TN and lower levels of PTA/TN. The peptide profiles of water-soluble extracts of the cheeses obtained by reversed-phase HPLC exhibited different patterns at all stages of ripening for the two rennets utilized, thus conveying important qualitative information for fundamental differentiation of proteolysis effected by either rennet.

However, management models are still being developed in order to improve and stabilize the production, which varies greatly from one year to another. According to gatherers and farmers, one of the key factors for desert truffle production is the plant phenology in spring, which, in turn, depends on environmental conditions. In this manuscript, we have characterized the physiological, morphological, and molecular responses of the mycorrhizal plants in spring, coinciding with the fructification period of the plant and fungal species. Thanks to this characterization, a sigmoidal relationship between stomatal conductance and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was found, which can be used as a marker of plant phenological switch. In order to confirm that this phenology status is related to desert truffle fructification, this marker has been successfully correlated to total truffle production. The results of this manuscript suppose a big step forward that will help to develop management models for the desert truffle crop.

Where susceptible varieties are grown, farmers control these diseases with routine fungicide applications. To determine an optimum application rate and spray schedule for Orius (R) (tebuconazole 250g/L), we sprayed 10mL and 20mL Orius (R) per 15 L spray water twice at two trifoliate leaf stage and 50% flowering, and three times at the same stages, with an additional application at pod initiation. In farmers' fields, we tested the effect of fungicide sprays, use of resistant variety, intercropping, increased plant spacing and farmyard manure on rust and ALS diseases. Application three times of 20mL Orius (R) per 15 L spray water reduced rust severity scores by 5.7 and 2.4 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Lowest rust and ALS severities were observed when a resistant variety, fungicide or farmyard manure was used. Pod yield increments due to disease management ranged between 13% and 242%. Prophylactic fungicide application, use of resistant varieties and farmyard manure can be used to reduce disease severity and improve snap bean quality on smallholder farms.

Our objective was to determine how soil temperature affects susceptibility of plants exposed to Fusarium virguliforme at different ages. Soybean plants were grown in rhizotrons in water baths at 17, 23, and 29 degrees C. Subsets of plants were inoculated 0, 3, 7, and 13 days after planting (DAP) by drenching soil with a conidial suspension. Root rot developed in all inoculated plants but severity decreased with increasing temperature and plant age at inoculation. Severity of foliar symptoms also decreased with increasing plant age. Whereas plants inoculated 0 DAP developed severe foliar symptoms at all temperatures, plants inoculated 3 and 7 DAP developed symptoms only at 17 and 23 degrees C, and those inoculated 13 DAP never developed foliar symptoms at any temperature. Root length at inoculation was negatively correlated with disease severity. Our findings suggest that roots are most susceptible to infection during the first days after seed germination and that accelerated root growth in warmer temperatures reduces susceptibility to root infection conducive to foliar symptoms. However, soil temperature may not affect infections that occur as soon as seeds germinate.	[Gongora-Canul, C. C.; Leandro, L. F.

The aim of the current study, was to evaluate the potential effects of dietary supplementation of date palm fruit extracts alone or in combination with Pdp11 probiotic on serum antioxidant status, on the humoral and cellular innate immune status, as well as, on the expression levels of some immune-related genes in head-kidney and gut of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) after 2 and 4 weeks of administration. This study showed for the first time in European sea bass an immunostimulation in several of the parameters evaluated in fish fed with date palm fruits extracts enriched diet or fed with this substance in combination with Pdp 11 probiotic, mainly after 4 weeks of treatment. In the same way, dietary supplementation of mixture diet has positive effects on the expression levels of immune-related genes, chiefly in head-kidney of Dicentrarchus labrax. Therefore, the combination of both could be considered of great interest as potential additives for farmed fish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Guardiola, F.

The aim of this study was to analyze maize respond to inoculation with Azotobacter sp and Burkholderia sp at the dose 50% of FN. Used an experimental design of randomized blocks. By response variables: percent germination (%), the shoot and root phenology: plant height (PH), root length (RL) and biomass: shoot fresh weight (SFW) and root fresh weight (RFW), the shoot dry weight (SDW) and root dry weight (RDW). The results indicated a positive maize respond to PGPB inoculation at germination, seedling and flowering level, reached a RDW of 7.03 g, statistically significant value compared with 2.60 g of RDW non inoculated maize feed with NF dose recommended regard as relative control (RC). This suggests a synergistic interaction among these PGPB in synthesis of plant growth promoting substances (PGPS) on maize, to optimize the reduced NF dose.

The evaluations were done with three sets of genotypes that were classified as partially resistant, intermediate, and susceptible to SDS based on previous field evaluations. These three sets were independently evaluated for greenhouse SDS reactions using cone and tray inoculation methods. Plants were infected using grains of white sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] infested with Fusarium solani f. sp. glycines. Foliar symptom severity was rated 21 days after emergence. The cone and field SDS ratings were significantly correlated and ranged from 0.69 forset 1 to 0.51 forset 3. Correlations of SDS ratings of genotypes between field and greenhouse tray ratings were significant forset 1 and not significant for set 2. The cone method showed the highest correlation with field results and is recommended to screen soybean genotypes for SDS resistance.

In each year, each type of spore occurred in a single dispersal period that lasted 25-35 days. Single, distinct spore showers that lasted 10-14 days occurred in each dispersal period. Ascospore dispersal periods began just before or at budbreak and continued until 0-7 days before bloom. Conidium showers began 32-33 days after initiation of ascospore showers. The presence of ascospores and conidia in the air exhibited a diurnal periodicity. Ascospores were trapped predominantly between 1000 and 2100 h, with a peak occurring between 1600 and 1800 h. Conidium concentrations peaked between 1000 and 1800 h. Temperature of the duff and upper canopy and relative humidity correlated best with the daily presence of airborne ascospores during the peak period of dispersal. These three variables and wind speed correlated best with the daily presence of airborne conidia during the peak period of dispersal. Percentage of bloom and of shoots with symptoms of primary infection were highly correlated with conidium shower intensity in both 1988 and 1989. Trap plants were placed in the field during the periods of ascospore dispersal in 1989 and 1990 and conidium dispersal in 1989. Shoots that were beginning to expand and had several nodes visible were most susceptible to infection by ascospores. Shoots inoculated with conidia did not develop tip blight symptoms. Ascospores were shown for the first time to infect flowers and cause typical cottonball fruit rot. In the field, fruit rot incidence did not change over time as berries developed, and airborne inocula were not present after bloom. This evidence supports previous observations that fruit rot results only from infection of flowers during bloom.

Soybean seeds were germinated for 1 day, and the cotyledonary node cells of half-seeds were wounded mechanically by using a multi-needle consisting of thin 30 fibers. The wounded half-seeds were inoculated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells harboring a recombinant DNA that contained the bar and sgfp genes conferring phosphinothricin (PPT)-resistance and green fluorescent protein (GFP) activity, respectively. The inoculated explants were selected on medium containing 5 or 3 mg PPT/l. The transformation efficiency of soybean was up to 12%. Polymerase chain reaction and genomic Southern blot analysis confirmed stable integration of the transgenes in the genome of the PPT-resistant plants. GFP analysis revealed that the transgenes were highly expressed in the plantlets. Adult plants were resistant to 100 mg PPT/l applied on the leaves, demonstrating their herbicide-resistance.

The cost-benefits of the tripartite symbiosis were investigated in terms of C-economy and nutrition. Nodulated Phaseolus vulgaris seedlings, with and without AM, were hydroponically grown tinder high (2 mM) and low (1 mu M) P conditions in an N-free Long Ashton nutrient solution. Plants were sequentially harvested at 17, 24 and 31 days after emergence. At each harvest, measurements for biomass, N-2-fixation, photosynthesis, root respiration, calculated C and nutritional economy were taken. Nodular growth was suppressed by the early development of AM colonization. This coincided with higher photosynthetic and respiratory rates in AM plants. These effects were most pronounced under low P when AM colonization peaked. Once AM levels reached the plateau phase, the efficiency of P nutrition increased. This was followed by improved nodular and host growth and enhanced N-2-fixation. This indicates that the AM was the dominant symbiont for host C in the tripartite symbiosis, due to its rapid development and subsequent role in supplying P more effectively to both host and nodules.

Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS; EC 2.3.1.14) is the key enzyme in the synthesis of sucrose in plants. The outcome of overexpression of SPS in different plants using transgenic approaches has been quite varied, but the general consensus is that increased SPS activity is associated with the production of new sinks and increased sink strength. In legumes, the root nodule is a strong C sink and in this study our objective was to see how increasing SPS activity in a legume would affect nodule number and function. Here we have transformed alfalfa (Medicago sativa, cv. Regen SY), with a maize SPS gene driven by the constitutive CaMV35S promoter. Our results showed that overexpression of SPS in alfalfa, is accompanied by an increase in nodule number and mass and an overall increase in nitrogenase activity at the whole plant level. The nodules exhibited an increase in the level of key enzymes contributing to N assimilation including glutamine synthetase and asparagine synthetase. Moreover, the stems of the transformants showed higher level of the transport amino acids, Asx, indicating increased export of N from the nodules. The transformants exhibited a dramatic increase in growth both of the shoots and roots, and earlier flowering time, leading to increased yields. Moreover, the transformants showed an increase in elemental N and protein content. The overall conclusion is that increased SPS activity improves the N status and plant performance, suggesting that the availability of more C in the form of sucrose enhances N acquisition and assimilation in the nodules.

Plant growth promotion by Bradyrhizobium japonicum under heavy metal stress	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Bioremediation; Heavy metal tolerance; Phytotoxicity; Plant-microbe interactions; Stress physiology	INDUCED INHIBITION; NICKEL TOXICITY; SOIL; RESISTANCE; BACTERIUM; COPPER; LEAD; BIOSYNTHESIS; MUTANTS; BIOFILM	The increase in usage of heavy metals in different industrial activities causes their existence in effluents. Excessive concentrations of these heavy metals pollute soil and water. Heavy metals cause toxicities and other harmful effects not only in humans and animals but also in plants and soil microorganisms. Heavy metals disrupt many biochemical and physiological activities in bacteria, including growth, development, enzyme and hormone production. Indole acetic acid (IAA) is one of the most important hormones in plants, which is secreted by both bacteria and plants. The present study assessed the effects of Ni, Pb and Cu on the growth of Bradyrhizobium japonicum and IAA production. B. japonicum were grown in yeast mannitol broth in a rotary shaker at 100 rpm for 18 h for each variant. Ni, Pb and Cu with concentrations ranging from 2.5-40 mg/L were added to B. japonicum cultures and turbidity was measured at 600 nm. Effects of Ni, Pb and Cu on IAA production were determined by measuring the IAA content with Salkowski method. The metal uptake by B. japonicum was determined in the range of 5-50 mg/L. A lettuce seedling assay was conducted to observe the effect of B. japonicum on plant growth under heavy metal stress. Lettuce seedlings inoculated with the bacterium were spiked with 5-500 mg/L of Ni, Pb and Cu. Shoot and root length, and plant dry biomass were measured after 5 days of germination. Bacterial growth was reduced with the increase of Ni and Cu concentrations. However, there was no significant growth effect with Pb in the considered range. The IAA production also followed the same pattern with Pb and Ni, but in the presence of Cu, IAA content was slightly increased and reached an equilibrium. The growth retardations observed in lettuce in the presence of Pb, Ni and Cu were in the decreasing order of Ni N Cu N Pb. Bacterial inoculation reduced the heavy metal stress and increased the shoot and root lengths of lettuce seedlings. FTIR spectrum of the bacterial biomass showed that amine and nitro groups are responsible in metal sorption process. The Pb-treated bacterial biomass showed a considerable difference in the FTIR spectrum compared to other treatments. According to our results, B. japonicum is sensitive to heavy metal stress with a retardation of growth and IAA production, though it is able to enhance the growth of lettuce seedlings under heavy metal stress.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of acybenzolar-S-methyl on Aphis gossypii (Glover) and Ramularia areola (Atkinson) in the cotton crop. The experiment was conducted in Selviria (MS). The experimental design was randomized blocks with plots in a factorial (2x6), constituted by the combination of two cotton cultivars (Acala-90 and DeltaOpal) and six treatments of resistance. The treatments were: 1) control, 2) acybenzolar-s-methyl (20 g i.a. ha(-1)), 3) acybenzolar-S-methyl + azoxystrobin (20 + 40 g i.a ha(-1)), 4) acybenzolar-s-methyl + thiophanate methyl (20 + 350 g i.a. ha(-1)), 5) azoxystrobin (40 g i.a. ha-1) and 6) thiophanate methyl (350 g i.a. ha(-1)). Aphis gossypii was evaluated with an interval of 10 days after the application of treatments. The severity of R. areola at 101, 109 and 116 days after emergence was analyzed in ten plants marked in the plot. The results show that applying acybenzolar-smethyl, alone or in combination with fungicides, the rates of 20 g i.a. ha(-1) reduced the population of A. gossypii. The acybenzolar-S-methyl (20 g i.a. ha-1) provided the lowest incidence of R. areola.

The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design, keeping combination of four cultivars (RGC 936, HG 563, RGC 1003 and RGC 1066) and three fertility levels (Recommended inorganic nutrition 20 kg N and 47.5 kg P2O5/ha, 75 % recommended inorganic nutrition + Rhizobium + phosphorous solublizing bacteria inoculation and 50 % recommended inorganic nutrition + 50 % N through farm yard manure). Guar cultivar RGC 1066 produced maximum seed and dry fodder yield which was statistically at par with RGC 1003 and HG 363 but significantly superior than RGC 936. Plant height and pods/plant were also maximum in RGC 1066 and at par with RGC 1003 and HG 563 but significantly superior over RGC 936. Among the fertility levels, yield attributes and seed yield did not differ significantly except the 50 % flowering and dry fodder yield. Dry fodder yield was significantly higher in plots where 50 % N was substituted with farm yard manure than 25 % inorganic nutrition substituted with inoculation with Rhizobium + PSB and 100 % recommended inorganic fertilized plots. Path coefficient analysis revealed that days to 50 % flowering (DTFF) and pods/plant (PPP) had positive direct effect on Seed yield (SY) with path coefficient of 2.270 and 1.119 at contribution of 38.48 and 19.77 per cent of the total effects, respectively. The direct effect of plant height (PH) on seed yield (SY) was comparatively larger but negative at coefficient value of -2.459 with 41.66 per cent contribution which resulted in significant correlation (r=0.985).

J	815		HERRIDGE, DF; HOLLAND, JF				HERRIDGE, DF; HOLLAND, JF			LOW NODULATION AND N2 FIXATION LIMITS YIELD OF PIGEONPEA ON ALKALINE VERTISOLS OF NORTHERN NSW - EFFECT OF IRON, RHIZOBIA AND PLANT GENOTYPE	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						ALKALINE; BLACK EARTHS; NODULATION; N2 FIXATION; UREIDES	NITRATE	Pigeonpea grown on the alkaline black earths (vertisols) of northern New South Wales often fails to fix detectable amounts of nitrogen (N), resulting in N deficient crops and depressed seed yields. We aimed to solve this problem through selection of plant genotypes that were adapted to these soil types. Selection criteria included the agronomic characteristics of maturity (days to flowering), determinacy and seed size, and symbiotic characteristics of nodulation and N2 fixation. In addition, the interactive effects of fertilizer Fe and N, plant genotype and strain of rhizobia on those characteristics were examined. The experiments reported were sown between November 1988 and December 1990 on alkaline vertisols (pH range 7.9-8.2) at Tamworth, Currabubula and Breeza, N.S.W. In Experiment 1, 108 genotypes were inoculated with Bradyrhizobium strain CB756 and sown at two sites. Nitrogen fixation could not be detected for 86 of the 100 genotypes sown at the Tamworth Agricultural Research Centre and for 51 of the 62 genotypes sown at Currabubula. Six of the genotypes had Pfix (proportion of plant N derived from N2 fixation) values of 10-19% compared with values of zero for five of the six combinations of three check cultivars (Quest, Quantum and Campea)x2 sites. A further five genotypes produced seed yields up to 0.20 t/ha (14%) higher than the average of the three check cultivars. Effects of fertilizer Fe (applied at sowing as FeEDDHA at rates of 0, 0.25, 1.0, 4.0 and 16.0 kg Fe/ha) and N (as nitram at 0 and 200 kg N/ha) and strain of Bradyrhizobium sp. (CB756 and CB1024) on symbiotic and yield parameters of pigeonpea cv. Quest were examined in Experiment 2. Nodulation at flowering was increased by as much as 300% by Fe; by early pod-fill, effects of Fe has almost disappeared. Pfix values were unaffected by Fe. Throughout growth, shoot dry matters increased with increasing rates of Fe, particularly when N was also applied. In the presence of fertilizer N, seed yields increased with increasing rates of Fe (1.67 t/ha at Fe0 to 2.43 t/ha at Fe16.0). Responses to Fe in the absence of N were reduced. Plants inoculated with rhizobial strain CB1024 outyielded plants inoculated with strain CB756 by 1.0 t/ha (Fe0) and 0.66 t/ha (Fe16.0). In Experiment 3, we examined the effects of fertilizer Fe on symbiotic and yield parameters of 14 genotypes of pigeonpea. There were significant differences between plant genotypes in nodulation, N2 fixation and yields of shoots and seed when fertilizer Fe was not applied and in responsiveness to applied Fe. Seed yields were increased by an average of 0.70 t/ha (108%) for highly responsive genotypes E33, M96, L133 and Campea, but only by an average of 0.32 t/ha (25%) for the low response group (E76, M48, M144 and Quest).

CLCuV transmission occurs in Sriganganagar (Rajasthan), an area endemic with cotton leaf curl disease. The relationships between plant viruses, their herbivore vectors and host plants can be beneficial, neutral, or antagonistic, depending on the species involved. To further understand these relationships, fecundity and life history parameters of an indigenous non-b (Asia II genetic group) biotype whitefly, B. tabaci, were compared on 10, 25, and 40 days post-inoculation (DPI), in CLCuV-infected and healthy cotton plants to determine the effect of virus on its vector. The development time of the immature stages of whiteflies was significantly reduced on CLCuV-infected plants. The development time of the immature stages did not change with severity of symptoms at 25 and 40 DPI (45-and 60-d-old plants). Cotton leaf curl virus infection increased percent egg viability of B. tabaci. Whiteflies deposited significantly fewer eggs on virus-infected plants than on healthy plants. Whiteflies had better egg viability on younger plants than older plants, whereas plant age did not affect the fecundity. Male and female whiteflies had shorter longevity on CLCuV-infected plants than on healthy plants.

Enhancement in nutrient uptake and/or production of antioxidants under the stress condition, can improve plant growth and yield. In this study, inoculation of Lallemantia iberica with Funneliformis mosseae and the sulfur solubilizing bacterium (Thiobacillus sp. T95 and T40) was evaluated under two salinity levels (6.72 dS/m and 0.91 dS/m as control). The root colonization, spore density, seed and biological yield, total soluble sugars, and nutrients were reduced by salt stress. Antioxidant enzyme activity (catalase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase), proline, contents of sodium and sulfur have increased under salt stress. The enzyme activities as well as the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and sulfur were dropped at the flowering stage (75 days after sowing). Seed and biological yield, antioxidant enzymes activity, proline content, and nutrients were significantly improved in mycorrhizal treatments. Inoculation of Thiobacillus exhibited the positive effect on root colonization, spore density, enzymes activity, and nutrients. Bacterial treatments (dual and single) significantly increased the sulfur and total soluble sugars. Totally, the mycorrhizal plants accumulated more enzymatically produced antioxidants, osmolytes, and showed improved nutrient uptake. Our results provide new insights into the relationship among arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), biosulfur bacteria, and plant growth under saline conditions. In conclusion, the Lallemantia iberica inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi, either alone, or in combination with Thiobacillus, is indicated for optimum plant yield through alleviation of the salinity stress.

Risk assessment of antimicrobial resistance along the food chain through culture-independent methodologies	EFSA JOURNAL			English	Article						Antimicrobial resistance; risk assessment; surveillance; food-borne pathogens; whole genome sequencing; metagenomics		Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major challenge for Public Health and the scientific community, and requires immediate and drastic solutions. Acquired resistance to certain antimicrobials is already widespread to such an extent that their efficacy in the treatment of certain life-threatening infections is already compromised. To date, the emergence and spread of AMR has been attributed to the use, misuse or indiscriminate use of antibiotics as therapeutic drugs in human, animal and plant health, or as growth promoters in veterinary husbandry. In addition, there is growing concern over the possibility of AMR transmission via the food chain. Food processing environments could act as potential hotspots for AMR acquisition and spread. Indeed, biocide use and exposure to food-related stresses and food processing technologies could presumably act as selection pressures for increased microbial resistance against clinically relevant antibiotics. Global AMR surveillance is critical for providing the necessary information to form global strategies and to monitor the effectiveness of public health interventions as well as to detect new trends and emerging threats. Surveillance of AMR is currently based on the isolation of indicator microorganisms and the phenotypic characterisation of the strains isolated. However, this approach provides very limited information on the mechanisms driving AMR or on the presence and spread of AMR genes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial pathogens is a powerful tool that can be used for epidemiological surveillance, outbreak detection and infection control. In addition, whole metagenome sequencing (WMS) allows for the culture-independent analysis of complex microbial communities, providing useful information on the occurrence of AMR genes. Both approaches can be used to provide the information necessary for the implementation of quantitative risk assessment of AMR transmission routes along the food chain.

Fully ripened cheeses (i.e. by 130 days) contained a total of 3.1 x 10(7) CFU g(-1) mesophilic bacteria, and a decrease in moisture content, concomitantly with an increase in salt content, was observed throughout the same time frame. The pH decreased until 30 days of ripening; thereafter, a slight increase was reported, up to 5.6 by the end of ripening. Urea-PAGE results showed extensive primary proteolysis, of both beta-casein and alpha(s1)-casein - degraded at essentially similar rates: plasmin and chymosin accordingly appear to be active in the cheese curd. RP-HPLC profiles of water-soluble fractions showed minor differences between 1 and 130 day old cheeses, whereas equivalent profiles of 7% (v/v) ethanol-soluble fractions contained several peaks, indicative of a heterogeneous mixture of products of proteolysis, that evolved with time.

Avalon) and triticale (cv. Lasko) harvested in 1990. The treatments consisted of factorial combinations of five levels of spring nitrogen (50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 kg N ha(-1)) with fungicide treatments designed to control foliar diseases. Seed was graded by size into different fractions. Application of foliar fungicides to the parent plant increased the proportion of large seed in wheat but not in triticale. Fungicide application had no effect on seed vigour (quantified as the value of Ki after controlled deterioration), final germination, median germination time (t(50)) Or rate of germination. Parent plant nutrition altered the proportions of seed in different size categories in triticale and wheat. In laboratory germination tests, final germination of wheat increased with seed size. Large (> 3.0 mm diameter) wheat seed from plots receiving 50 kg N ha(-1) had a lower final germination than large seed from plots which had received greater amounts of nitrogen, but t(50) and K-i were similar for all nitrogen levels. In triticale, the higher the seed weight, the higher the final germination, the faster the rate and the higher the K-i. Final germination, t(50) and K-i, were all positively correlated with the amount of nitrogen received by the parent plants. Parent plant nutrition had no effect on the response to temperature of final germination, t(50), Or rate of germination for large or small seeds of both wheat and triticale.

Link: Spore abundance and root colonisation in six locations of the European coast	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Ammophila arenaria; arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Mediterranean climate; root colonisation; sand dunes; seasonal variation	SEASONAL DYNAMICS; ASSOCIATIONS; NEMATODES; GLOMALES	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are common organisms in the rhizhosphere of plants in coastal sand dunes where they play a key role in the establishment, growth and survival of plants. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the AMF associated with Ammophila arenaria, the most important sand-fixing species in the foredunes of Europe, in six locations along the western European coast. Spore abundance and root colonisation by AMF were estimated in July 2003, October 2003 and April 2004. The number of spores varied significantly with time and location. A clear peak of sporulation in autumn was found for three of the northern sites, but no pattern was detected in the southern sites. Root colonisation showed no seasonal pattern, despite differences between sampling times. Both hyphal coils and arbuscules were observed inside the roots, indicating colonisation by more than one AMF species. No correlation was found between root colonisation and spore number, or between AMF abundance and soil fertility. We conclude that: (a) spore production is driven by climatic conditions in the studied northern sites and by plant phenology in the studied southern sites; and that (b) root colonisation is independent of climate, phenology and soil fertility in the studied locations.

Exposing fruit to ozone for 4 and 6 h delayed disease incidence and reduced severity. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that exposing fruit to ozone for 4 and 6 h reduced growth of fungi on the fruit peel. The activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase were increased after ozone fumigation and remained significantly higher than those of the control fruit through three days of storage at 25 degrees C.

Strengthening Invasion Filters to Reassemble Native Plant Communities: Soil Resources and Phenological Overlap	RESTORATION ECOLOGY			English	Article						carbon addition; community assembly; functional traits; limiting similarity; nitrogen; phenology	RESTORATION; DIVERSITY; NITROGEN; TRAITS; SUCCESSION; DOMINANCE; GRASSES	Preventing invasion by exotic species is one of the key goals of restoration, and community assembly theory provides testable predictions about native community attributes that will best resist invasion. For instance, resource availability and biotic interactions may represent filters that limit the success of potential invaders. Communities are predicted to resist invasion when they contain native species that are functionally similar to potential invaders; where phenology may be a key functional trait. Nutrient reduction is another common strategy for reducing invasion following native species restoration, because soil nitrogen (N) enrichment often facilitates invasion. Here, we focus on restoring the herbaceous community associated with coastal sage scrub vegetation in Southern California; these communities are often highly invaded, especially by exotic annual grasses that are notoriously challenging for restoration. We created experimental plant communities composed of the same 20 native species, but manipulated functional group abundance (according to growth form, phenology, and N-fixation capacity) and soil N availability. We fertilized to increase N, and added carbon to reduce N via microbial N immobilization. We found that N reduction decreased exotic cover, and the most successful seed mix for reducing exotic abundance varied depending on the invader functional type. For instance, exotic annual grasses were least abundant when the native community was dominated by early active forbs, which matched the phenology of the exotic annual grasses. Our findings show that nutrient availability and the timing of biotic interactions are key filters that can be manipulated in restoration to prevent invasion and maximize native species recovery.

A symbiotic balancing act: arbuscular mycorrhizal specificity and specialist fungus gnat pollination in the mycoheterotrophic genus Thismia (Thismiaceae)	ANNALS OF BOTANY			English	Article						Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Corynoptera fungus gnats; mycoheterotrophy; pollination ecology; Rhizophagus; specificity; symbiosis; Thismia tentaculata; xenogamy	PLANT; EVOLUTION; BIOLOGY; DIVERSIFICATION; ORCHIDACEAE; COMMUNITIES; DIVERGENCE; MUTUALISMS; SPECIATION; DIVERSITY	Background and Aims Mycorrhizal associations in mycoheterotrophic plants are generally more specialized than in autotrophs. Mycoheterotrophs typically bear small, inconspicuous flowers that often self-pollinate to maximize seed set, although some have structurally complex flowers indicative of xenogamy. A trade-off has previously been proposed between specialization in these above- and below-ground symbioses, although empirical data are lacking. Methods We used next-generation DNA sequencing to compare the mycorrhizal communities from the roots of a mycoheterotrophic species, Thismia tentaculata (Thismiaceae), and its neighbouring autotrophs. We furthermore conducted detailed assessments of floral phenology and pollination ecology, and performed artificial pollination experiments to determine the breeding system. Key Results Thismia tentaculata maintains a symbiotic association with a single arbuscular mycorrhizal Rhizophagus species. The flowers are pollinated by a single species of fungus gnats (Corynoptera, Sciaridae), which are attracted by the yellow pigments and are temporarily restrained within the perianth chamber before departing via apertures between the anthers. The plants are self-compatible but predominantly xenogamous. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that T. tentaculata maintains highly specialized associations with pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi, both of which are widely distributed. We suggest that specialization in multiple symbiotic interactions is possible in mycoheterotrophs if redundant selective pressures are not exerted to further restrict an already constrained suite of life-history traits.

No differences were found in mixing treatments or methods of packing or shipping samples. However, extraction using Cobb's sifting and gravity method, followed by sucrose centrifugation, gave greater recovery of free-living nematodes than elutriation followed by sucrose centrifugation. Population means and variance of the sampled area were similar when sampled using different strategies for collecting soil samples within fields, including several patterns, directions and repetitions of transects. Components of variation associated with ratios among the five trophic groups of nematodes and selected indices of community structure were quantified as variation among regions, among counties, among agricultural fields (2-ha area), among transects within agricultural fields, and within composite soil samples. The variance component for 'within composite soil samples' was relatively large compared to the other components of variance. Variation within composite soil samples was less for maturity indices (based on life-history strategy characteristics), ratio of bacterivores to plant-parasites, sum of bacterivores and fungivores, populations of plant-parasites, and populations of bacterivores than for trophic diversity indices, populations of fungivores, populations of omnivores, populations of predators, or the ratio of fungivores to bacterivores. With a single composite sample per field, the ability to differentiate ecological condition of soils among fields within a region improved if the variance among and within fields exceeded the variance within composite samples. Given the variance components, power curves indicated that detection of a 10% change (with 0.8 power) in the ecological condition of soils within a region between two time periods would require sampling a minimum of 25 and 50 fields with one composite soil sample analyzed per field for the maturity and trophic diversity index, respectively. More than 100 fields per region would be required to detect temporal change in populations of individual trophic groups. Biplots of maturity indices, but not of trophic diversity or populations of individual trophic groups, identified clear differences among fields. Thus, maturity indices, which differentiated among sampling sites better and more efficiently than trophic diversity indices or measures based on populations of individual trophic groups, may be appropriate for use in a regional and/or national monitoring program.

VESICATORIA; AMMONIA-LYASE ACTIVITY; PEROXIDASE-ACTIVITY; RESISTANCE; TOMATO; PLANTS; SUSPENSION; INDUCTION; LEAVES; GENES	Pre-treatment with low dose of aluminium sulphate [Al-2(SO4)(3)] was assayed on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings for its ability to induce resistance against Fusarium oxysporum infection. Pre-treatment of seven days old germinated wheat seedlings with 50 mu M concentration of Al-2(SO4)(3) reduced the severity of the disease. In Al-2(SO4)(3) pre-treated seedlings inoculated with fungus reduction in disease severity was correlated with suppression of fungal mycelia development inside the leaf tissues. The activities of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia lyase were determined as resistance markers. F. oxysporum inoculation induced significant increase of all these enzymes. Such responses were expressed earlier and with much higher magnitude when Al-2(SO4)(3) pre-treated seedlings were challenged with the pathogen. Slower disease development in Al-2(SO4)(3) pre-treated seedlings might be due to increased deposition of total phenolic compounds and enhanced level of salicylic acid which restricts pathogen entry.

Effect of the anther-smut fungus Microbotryum on the juvenile growth of its host Silene latifolia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						asymptomatic infection; endophyte; latent period; metapopulation; plant pathogen; recovery; resistance; resistance costs; root-shoot ratio; systemic infection	MATING-TYPE CHROMOSOMES; DIOICA L CLAIRV; USTILAGO-VIOLACEA; PLANT-DISEASE; EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS; GENOTYPIC VARIATION; SPORE DEPOSITION; MODEL SYSTEM; INFECTION; PATHOGEN	PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Plant pathogens that form persistent systemic infections within plants have the potential to affect multiple plant life history traits, yet we tend to focus only on visible symptoms. Anther smut of Silene latifolia caused by the fungus Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae induces the anthers of its host to support fungal spore production instead of pollen, and the pathogen is primarily transmitted among flowering plants by pollinators. Nevertheless, most of its life cycle is spent in the asymptomatic vegetative phase, and spores falling on seedlings or nonflowering plants can also infect the host.The purpose of this study was to ask whether the fungus also had an effect on its host plant in the juvenile vegetative phase before flowering as this is important for the disease dynamics in species where infection of seedlings is commonplace. METHODS: Leaf length and leaf number of inoculated and uninoculated juvenile plants were compared in greenhouse experiments, and in one experiment, disease status of the plants at flowering was determined. KEY RESULTS: Inoculated plants had shorter but more leaves, and reduced root mass at the early juvenile (preflowering) stage. Some of these effects were detectable in plants that were inoculated but showed no disease symptoms at flowering. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that pathogenic fungi can have endophyte-like effects even in the total absence of their typical and more charismatic symptoms, and conversely that the assessment of endophyte effects on the fitness of their hosts should include all stages of the host life cycle.

In non-infected root the amounts of barley lectin and WGA decreased rapidly for 4 days after germination, whereas in nematode-infected roots their amounts dropped slowly. In H. avenae infected wheal roots the WGA precursor was observed 4-6 days after inoculation, whereas a barley-lectin precursor was not detected in barley roots. These phenomena were also observed in seedlings treated with abscisic acid and jasmonic acid. Immunohistological studies revealed the presence of WGA in epidermal cells of the root tip and in the nematode feeding-sire (syncytium) region. Commercial WGA bound to the cuticular surface of H. avenae J2 in vitro. WGA did not accumulate in wheat roots inoculated with J2 of another cereal cyst nematode, H. latipons, and the commercial WGA did not bind to the J2 surface in vitro. The lectins are suggested to play a role in the H. avenae-plant interaction. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of seeds enriched with P and Mo on growth and biological N-2 fixation of the common bean by the N-15 isotope dilution technique. An experiment was carried out in pots in a 2x3x2x2 factorial design in randomized blocks with four replications, comprising two levels of soil applied P (0 and 80 mg kg(-1)), three N sources (without N, inoculated with rhizobia, and mineral N), two seed P concentrations (low and high), and two seed Mo concentrations (low and high). Non-nodulating bean and sorghum were used as non-fixing crops. The substrate was 5.0 kg of a Red Latosol (Oxisol) previously enriched with N-15 and mixed with 5.0 kg of sand. Plants were harvested 41 days after emergence. Seeds with high P concentration increased the growth and N in shoots, particularly in inoculated plants at lower applied P levels. Inoculated plants raised from high P seeds showed improved nodulation at both soil P levels. Higher soil P levels increased the percentage of N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) in bean leaves. Inoculation with the selected strains increased the %Ndfa. High seed P increased the %Ndfa in inoculated plants at lower soil P levels. High seed Mo increased the %Ndfa at lower soil P levels in plants that did not receive inoculation or mineral N. It is concluded that high seed P concentration increases the growth, N accumulation and the contribution of the biological N-2 fixation in the common bean, particularly in inoculated plants grown at lower soil P availability.

Such gases affect the root system of plants growing on these sites. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects induced by landfill biogas contamination on germination and initial root growth of Vicia villosa (hairy vetch), Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil), Trifolium pratense (red clover), and Trifolium repens (white clover). In laboratory conditions, simulated landfill and control gas were supplied to the seedlings. The composition of the simulated landfill gas used was: 16% O-2, 8% CO2, 3% CH4, and 73% N-2; a control gas was also tested (21% O-2, 0. 035% CO2, and 78% N-2). Percentage of germinated seeds was determined after 6 and 12 days from the starting date; at the same time qualitative assays of metabolic root functionality were also performed by using an agar technique in order to visualize changes in rhizosphere pH. At the end of the experiment, the length of the primary and secondary root was measured. Germination after 6 days was affected by the gas treatment; the landfill biogas caused a delay in germination with respect to the control in seeds of V. villosa and L. corniculatus. Root fresh weight and dry weight were significantly decreased by biogas treatment in V. villosa and T. repens. In contrast, root dry weight was higher in gas treated L. corniculatus and T. pratense compared to control seedlings. Total root system was significantly higher in treated T. pratense. The qualitative assay suggests, with the exception of T. pratense, a metabolic adjustment of the treated seedlings.

Z. mays seeds were inoculated with B. bassiana strains (GHA, PTG4, and PTG6), using 1 x 10(6) blastospores/mL and methyl cellulose (MC) or cornstarch (CS) as adherents. Colonization was determined by B. bassiana recovery from plant tissues plated on PDA medium. Plant height, fresh and dry weight, and flowering time were analyzed to assess plant performance. Drought tolerance was evaluated by stopping watering for 10 days, watering again, and determining vigor recovery after 24 h. Results showed 100% endophytic roots colonization, regardless of adherent type or strain tested. Colonization was variable in shoots and leaves, but GHA strain achieved the highest inoculation rates, including 88% in stems and 50% in leaves, which did not depend on adherent type used; for PTG4 strain, adherent type had an important effect (MC = 100% stems and leaves; CS = 63% stems and 25% leaves). For PTG6 strain, the best adherent type was CS (71% stems and 75% leaves), whereas MC showed variable inoculation percentage (25% stems and 75% leaves). Interestingly, only MCPTG4 treatment showed consistent positive effects on germination percentage (day 5 = 46 +/- 2%; day 14 = 87 +/- 7%) compared with controls (CC = 63 +/- 4%, CMC = 50 +/- 3%, CCS = 47 +/- 0%). In addition, the other treatments showed low germination percentages at day 5 (7 +/- 7% to 46 +/- 2%), which recovered at day 14 (53 +/- 0% to 73 +/- 8%), except for MCPTG6 treatment with 23 +/- 10% germination. About plant performance, not significant effects on plant height and fresh/dry weight in all the treatments were observed. However, B. bassiana-treated plants, using either GHA, PTG4 or PTG6 strains, and MC as adherent, showed tolerance to drought and flowered one to two weeks earlier, providing evidence supporting further applications of these seed treatments in agricultural systems, for abiotic stress sustainable management practices.

In this study, the diversity of bacterial endophytes associated with a Bt maize genotype (Mon810) and its isogenic non-transgenic parental line were investigated at pre-flowering (50 days) and post-flowering (90 days) developmental stages. PCR-DGGE and high throughput sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq sequencer were used to characterize bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity in leaves, stems, seeds and tassels. PCR-DGGE profile revealed similarity as well as differences between bacterial communities of shoots in both cultivars and at both developmental stages. A total of 1771 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from the MiSeq and assigned into 14 phyla, 27 classes, 58 orders, 116 families and 247 genera. Differences in alpha and beta diversity measures of OTUs between the phyllospheres of both genotypes were not significant (P>.05) at all developmental stages. In all cultivars, OTU diversity reduced with plant development. OTUs belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria were dominant in all maize phyllospheres. The class Gammaproteobacteria was dominant in Bt maize while, Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria were dominant in non-Bt maize phyllospheres. Differences in the abundance of some genera, including Acidovorax, Burkerholderia, Brachybacterium, Enterobacter and Rhodococcus, whose species are known beneficial endophytes were observed between cultivars. Hierarchical cluster analysis further suggests that the bacterial endophyte communities of both maize genotypes associate differently (are dissimilar). Overall, the results suggest that bacterial endophytes community differed more across developmental stages than between maize genotypes. [GRAPHICS] .

An alternative for removing WMO from soil is by biostimulation (BIS) applying animal manure and then phytoremediation (PR) by legume improving with plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) to reduce WMO concentration at level below 4400 ppm limit permit for the NOM-138-SEMARNAT/SSA1-2012 (NOM-138). The aims of this research were: i) to analyze soil biostimulation polluted by 10000 ppm of WMO applying vermicompost, then subsequent soil phytoremediation with Cicer arietinum inoculated by Bacillus cereus and/or Rhizobium etli. In soil after applying BS by VC was measured WMO soil concentration and ii) for PR was regarded phenology and biomass of C. arietinum and WMO concentration remaining at the end of this step. The results showed that soil biostimulated by VC, WMO was reduced at 1370 ppm, subsequent PR sowing C. arietinum with R. etli, WMR was reduced at 30 ppm concentration both values below to maximum value accepted by NOM-138. Those data indicate that in soil polluted by WMO the best way to biorecovery soil was to integrate strategy BS/PR the last one improved by genus of PGPB. (C) 2016.

Several biotic and abiotic constraints have been reported that partially explain such failure, but the effects of the slurry components on the performance of native species have not been evaluated so far. We used germination tests to assess the effects of four such components bacteria-based fertilizing agent, biostimulant, dye and surfactant on the germination of 12 native species used in hydroseeding of quarry slopes. Hydroseeding components significantly affected germination only in four species. Bacteria-based fertilizing agent, biostimulant and a mixture of the four components increased the germination percentage of Thymus mastichina while bacteria-based fertilizing agent and biostimulant decreased the germination speed of Cistus albidus. Component- and species-specific effects on time to germination were observed in Bituminaria bituminosa, C. albidus, Helichrysum stoechas and T. mastichina. The results showed that only a few of the native species studied were affected by a specific hydroseeding component. Therefore, poor establishment of native species observed in the field could not be wholly attributed to negative effects of those components on their germination. These might have contributed to failure in the field by further reducing the low germination speed of certain species. This study suggests that a better knowledge of species characteristics and species-specific responses to hydroseeding components may help to improve the success and the cost-effectiveness of this restoration procedure.

Aphids host the obligatory endosymbiont Buchnera, which is required for reproduction, together with facultative symbionts whose frequencies vary across aphid populations. These maternally transmitted secondary symbionts have been particularly studied in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, which harbors at least 8 distinct bacterial species (not counting Buchnera) having environmentally dependent effects on host fitness. In particular, these symbiont species are associated with pea aphid populations feeding on specific plants. Although they are maternally inherited, these bacteria are occasionally transferred across insect lineages. One mechanism of such nonmaternal transfer is paternal transmission to the progeny during sexual reproduction. To date, transmission of secondary symbionts during sexual reproduction of aphids has been investigated in only a handful of aphid lineages and 3 symbiont species. To better characterize this process, we investigated inheritance patterns of 7 symbiont species during sexual reproduction of pea aphids through a crossing experiment involving 49 clones belonging to 9 host-specialized biotypes, and 117 crosses. Symbiont species in the progeny were detected with diagnostic qualitative PCR at the fundatrix stage hatching from eggs and in later parthenogenetic generations. We found no confirmed case of paternal transmission of symbionts to the progeny, and we observed that maternal transmission of a particular symbiont species (Serratia symbiotica) was quite inefficient. We discuss these observations in respect to the ecology of the pea aphid.

We sought to characterize the progression of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), dark septate endophytes (DSE), and fine root endophytes (FRE) over an alpine growing season, and to understand the role of the host plant and environment in driving colonization levels. We sampled four forbs on a regular schedule from June 26th-September 11th from a moist meadow (3535 m a.s.l) on Niwot Ridge, Rocky Mountain Front Range, CO, USA. We quantified the degree of root colonization by storage structures, exchange structures, and hyphae of all three groups of fungi. AMF and FRE percent colonization fluctuated significantly over time, while DSE did not. All AMF structures changed over time, and the degree of change in vesicles differed by plant species. FRE hyphae, AMF arbuscules and AMF vesicles peaked late in the season as plants produced seeds. AMF hyphae levels started high, decreased, and then increased within 20 days, highlighting the dynamic nature of plant-fungal interactions. Overall, our results show that AMF and FRE, not DSE, root colonization rapidly changes over the course of a growing season and these changes are driven by plant phenology and seasonal changes in the environment.

Bacterial Tradeoffs in Growth Rate and Extracellular Enzymes	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						extracellular enzyme; leaf litter; life history strategy; maximum growth rate; phylogenetic conservation; soil bacteria; trait tradeoff	SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; TOLERANCE TRAITS; DROUGHT; DECOMPOSITION; RESPONSES; STOICHIOMETRY; STRATEGY; GENES	Like larger organisms, bacteria possess traits, or phenotypic characteristics, that influence growth and impact ecosystem processes. Still, it remains unclear how these traits are organized across bacterial lineages. Using 49 bacterial strains isolated from leaf litter in Southern California, we tested the hypothesis that bacterial growth rates trade off against extracellular enzyme investment. We also tested for phylogenetic conservation of these traits under high and low resource conditions represented, respectively, by Luria broth (LB) and a monomer-dominated medium extracted from plant litter. In support of our hypotheses, we found a negative correlation between the maximum growth rate and the total activity of carbon-, nitrogen-, and phosphorus-degrading extracellular enzymes. However, this tradeoff was only observed under high resource conditions. We also found significant phylogenetic signal in maximum growth rate and extracellular enzyme investment under high and low resource conditions. Driven by our bacterial trait data, we proposed three potential life history strategies. Resource acquisition strategists invest heavily in extracellular enzyme production. Growth strategists invest in high growth rates. Bacteria in a third category showed lower potential for enzyme production and growth, so we tentatively classified them as maintenance strategists that may perform better under conditions we did not measure. These strategies were related to bacterial phylogeny, with most growth strategists belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria and most maintenance and resource acquisition strategists belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria. By accounting for extracellular enzyme investment, our proposed life history strategies complement existing frameworks, such as the copiotroph-oligotroph continuum and Grime's competitor-stress tolerator-ruderal triangle. Our results have biogeochemical implications because allocation to extracellular enzymes versus growth or stress tolerance can determine the fate and form of organic matter cycling through surface soil.

Free-living, filamentous plants are seasonal, March-July, with peak percent cover (10%) in April. Plants are fertile immediately after establishment. The unicells, previously identified as Chlorochytrium inclusum and Codiolum petrocelidis, are the sporophyte phase of Acrosiphonia. 'Chlorochytrium,' spherical and 160-280 mum in diameter, colonizes the foliose red alga Mazzaella splendens 1 mc, after filamentous Acrosiphonia plants appear. Maximum density (53 'Chlorochytrium' cells/cm(2) of blade) was recorded in May. 'Codiolum,' on the other hand, is stalked (the vesicle measures 150 x 50 mum) and colonizes the red algal crust Petrocelis. Peak density (22400 'Codiolum' cells/cm(2) of crust) was recorded 2 mc, after 'Chlorochytrium' density peaked. The endophytes survive high summer temperatures, which correlate with death of the free-living plants, and overwinter in their hosts. Zoospore release in late winter corresponds to decreased host abundance, suggesting the endophytes have evolved a strategy whereby duration in the host is synchronized with host seasonality. A bet-hedging strategy is proposed for Acrosiphonia's life history: two morphologically different phases have adapted to a seasonally variable environment, with the sporophyte phase capable of colonizing two different hosts.

Influence of silicon on some components of resistance to anthracnose in susceptible and resistant sorghum lines	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Acervulus; Colletotrichum sublineolum; Foliar disease; Host resistance; Silicon; Sorghum bicolor	COLLETOTRICHUM-GRAMINICOLA; HOST-RESISTANCE; SHEATH BLIGHT; RICE; FERTILIZATION; SUBLINEOLUM; INFECTION; WHEAT; BLAST	This study aimed to evaluate the effect of silicon (Si) rates on some components of sorghum resistance to anthracnose. Two 2x5 factorial experiments, consisting of two sorghum lines (BR005 and BR009, resistant and susceptible, respectively) and five Si application rates (0, 0.06, 0.12, 0.24 and 0.30 g Si kg(-1) of soil) were arranged in a completely randomised design with three replications. Plants from both lines were inoculated with a conidial suspension of Colletotrichum sublineolum (1x10(6) conidia ml(-1)) 30 days after emergence. The incubation period (IP), latent period (LP60), area under relative infection efficiency progress curve (AURIEPC), area under anthracnose index progress curve (AUAIPC), final disease severity (FDS), percentage of pigmented leaf area (PLA), and percentage of necrotic leaf area (NLA) were evaluated. Silicon and calcium (Ca) content in leaf tissue of both lines was also determined. The content of Si in leaf tissue increased relative to the control by 55 and 58%, respectively, for the susceptible and resistant lines. There was no significant change in Ca content in leaf tissue for either of the lines; therefore the variations in Si accounted for differences in the level of disease response. The IP for the resistant line was not affected by Si application rates. The LP60 was not evaluated in the resistant line due to the absence of acervuli. For the resistant line, Si application rates had no significant effect on AUAIPC, FDS, percentage of PLA, and percentage of NLA. On the susceptible line, a quadratic regression model best described the effect of Si application rates on IP, LP60, AURIEPC, AUAIPC, FDS, percentage of PLA, and percentage of NLA. The correlation between Si content in leaf tissue of the susceptible line and the AURIEPC, AUAIPC, FDS, PLA, and NLA was negatively significant (r = -0.57, -0.37, -0.40, -0.67, and -0.77, respectively). There was no correlation between Si content and IP or LP60. The correlation between the percentage of PLA with the percentage of NLA was negatively significant (r = -0.74). In conclusion, the results from this study underscore the importance of Si in sorghum resistance to anthracnose particularly for the susceptible line.

Characterization of growth-promoting rhizobacteria in Eucalyptus nitens seedlings	REVISTA ARGENTINA DE MICROBIOLOGIA			Spanish	Article						Eucalyptus nitens; PGPR; Indoleacetic acid; Phosphate solubilizing bacteria; ACC deaminase	PLANT-GROWTH; ACC DEAMINASE; BACTERIAL WILT; SOIL; PGPR; L.; INOCULATION; SUPPRESSION; ENHANCEMENT; PHYLOGENIES	Rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria were isolated from the rizosphere and root tissue of Eucalyptus nitens. The objective of this work was to evaluate their capacity to promote growth in seedlings of the same species under greenhouse conditions. The isolates that improved seedling growth were identified and characterized by their capacity to produce indoleacetic acid (IAA), solubilize phosphates and increase 1-aminocyclopropane-1carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity. One hundred and five morphologically different strains were isolated, 15 of which promoted E. nitens seedling growth, significantly increasing the height (50%), root length (45%) as well as the aerial and root dry weight (142% and 135% respectively) of the plants. Bacteria belonged to the genus Arthrobacter, Lysinibacillus, Rahnella and Bacillus. Isolates A. phenanthrenivorans 21 and B. cereus 113 improved 3.15 times the emergence of E. nitens after 12 days, compared to control samples. Among isolated R. aquatilis, 78 showed the highest production of IAA (97.5 +/- 2.87 ml) in the presence of tryptophan and the highest solubilizer index (2.4) for phosphorus, while B. amyloliquefaciens 60 isolate was positive for ACC deaminase activity. Our results reveal the potential of the studied rhizobacteria as promoters of emergence and seedling growth of E. nitens, and their possible use as PGPR inoculants, since they have more than one mechanism associated with plant growth promotion.

To evaluate the contribution of N-2 fixation to the nitrogen (N) economy in this alder stand, we also measured the phenology of the alder, the litterfall, the decomposition rate of the leaf litter, and N accumulation in the soil. The acetylene reduction activity per unit nodule mass (ARA) under field conditions appeared after bud break, peaked the maximum in midsummer after full expansion of the leaves, and disappeared after all leaves had fallen. There was no consistent correlation between ARA and tree size (dbh). The amount of N-2 fixed in this alder stand was estimated at 56.4 kg ha(-1) year(-1) when a theoretical molar ratio of 3 was used to convert the amount of reduced acetylene to the amount of fixed N-2. This amount of N-2 fixation corresponded to the 66.4% of N in the leaf litter produced in a year. These results suggested that N-2 fixation still contributed to the large portion of N economy in this alder stand.

J	844		Miki, T; Doi, H				Miki, Takeshi; Doi, Hideyuki			Leaf phenological shifts and plant-microbe-soil interactions can determine forest productivity and nutrient cycling under climate change in an ecosystem model	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Carbon and nitrogen cycling; Decomposition; Growing season; Plant-soil feedback; Temperature	GROWING-SEASON; TEMPERATURE RESPONSE; LONG-TERM; CARBON; TREE; FEEDBACK; NITROGEN; IMPACT; GROWTH; CO2	Climate change is expected to affect tree leaf phenology by extending the length of the growing season (LGS), which will affect the productivity and nutrient cycling of forests. Interactions between plants and microbes will mediate the ecosystem processes further through microbe-mediated plant-soil feedback (PSF). To investigate the possible consequences of interactions between the extension of the growing season (GS) and PSF under various conditions, we developed a simple theoretical model (LGS-PSF model). The LGS-PSF model predicts that microbe-mediated PSF will intensify the negative effects of increasing temperature on the size of soil carbon stock when compared with simulations without the PSF effect. The combined effects of increasing temperature and PSF on the size of soil carbon stock occurs through enhanced activity of individual microbes and increased microbial population size. More importantly, the model also demonstrated that a longer GS mitigates this negative effect on carbon accumulation in soil, not through increased net primary production, but through intensified competition for nutrients between plants and microbes, thus suppressing microbial population growth. Our model suggested that the interactive effects of the LGS and PSF on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in forests should be incorporated into larger scale quantitative models for better forecasting of future forest functions under climate change.

POSTHARVEST BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF MELON PATHOGENS USING BACILLUS SUBTILIS EXWB1	JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						melon; Bacillus subtilis; postharvest biocontrol mechanism; respiration; ethylene production	FRUIT; PLANT; ROT; COLONIZATION; STRAINS; FUNGI	Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is a widely used fruit which suffers from postharvest decay resulting in large economic losses. In this work we investigated the biological control of melon postharvest diseases using Bacillus subtilis EXWB1, which we had previously isolated and identified from melon in lab experiments. We found that this bacterium excretes a bio-surfactant in Luria-Bertani broth (pH 5-8) that helps it to stick to the hydrophobic melon skin, and spreads at a speed of 125 pm per h over the surface at room temperature and high humidity. During storage time we found that the peak of respiration of melon fruits increased on day 6, and was reduced by 26.1% and 71.9%, respectively in the presence of B. subtilis EXWB1 in inoculated and uninoculated treatments. The ethylene production peak was delayed by about 2 days and reduced by 72.3% and 61.6% on day 4. Growth of one of the main fungal pathogens of melon, Alternaria alternata, was limited around inoculated sites on the fruit surface, and necrotic lesions induced by this pathogen were significantly reduced by 77.2% after coinoculation with B. subtilis EXWB1. Treated fruits retained high levels of sugar and vitamin C, and low levels of organic acids, and maintained water content and turgidity at room temperature. Our findings provide an alternative and promising biological control agent, B. subtilis EXWB1, which can suppress postharvest diseases caused by A. alternata, and may effectively control postharvest physiological changes caused by fungal pathogens.

Multivariate statistics applied to the reaction of common bean plants to parasitism by Meloidogyne javanica	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Genetic resistance; Landrace genotypes; Phaseolus vulgaris L.; Root-knot nematode	ROOT-KNOT NEMATODES; GENETIC DIVERSITY; RAPD MARKERS; CULTIVARS; ACCESSIONS; RESISTANCE; LETTUCE; SOIL	The availability of common bean cultivars tolerant to Meloidogyne javanica is limited in Brazil. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the reactions of 33 common bean genotypes (23 landrace, 8 commercial, 1 susceptible standard and 1 resistant standard) to M. javanica, employing multivariate statistics to discriminate the reaction of the genotypes. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse using a completely randomized design with seven replicates. The seeds were sown in 1-L pots containing autoclaved soil and sand in a 1:1 ratio (v:v). On day 19, after emergence of the seedlings, the plants were treated with inoculum containing 4000 eggs + second-stage juveniles (J2). At 60 days after inoculation, the seedlings were evaluated based on biometric and parasitism-related traits, such as number of galls, final nematode population per root system, reproduction factor, and percent reduction in the reproduction factor of the nematode (% RRF). The data were subjected to analysis of variance using the F-test. The Mahalanobis generalized distance was used to obtain the dissimilarity matrix, and the average linkage between groups was used for clustering. The use of multivariate statistics allowed groups to be separated according to the resistance levels of genotypes, as observed in the % RRF. The landrace genotypes FORT-09, FORT-17, FORT-31, FORT-32, FORT-34 and FORT-36 presented resistance to M. javanica; thus, these genotypes can be considered potential sources of resistance.

Antifungal effect and reduction of Ulmus minor symptoms to Ophiostoma novo-ulmi by carvacrol and salicylic acid	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Dutch elm disease; phenolic compounds; tree resistance; tree phenology	DUTCH ELM DISEASE; PLANT ESSENTIAL OILS; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; RESISTANCE; COMPONENTS; PATHOGENS; GROWTH; AGENT; TREES	There are still no effective means to control Dutch elm disease (DED), caused by the vascular fungi Ophiostoma ulmi and O. novo-ulmi. Plant phenolics may provide a new strategy for DED control, given their known antifungal activity against pathogens and their involvement in plant defence mechanisms. The in vitro antifungal activity of salicylic acid, carvacrol, thymol, phenol, o-cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol, and 2,5-xylenol against the DED pathogens was tested. Also, the protective effect of watering Ulmus minor seedlings with these compounds was tested against O. novo-ulmi. Salicylic acid, carvacrol, and thymol showed the strongest antifungal in vitro activity, while carvacrol and salicylic acid provided the strongest in vivo protection against O. novo-ulmi (63 and 46% reduction of leaf wilting symptoms with respect to controls, respectively). The effect of the treatments on tree phenology was low, and a significant negative relation was observed between the number of days to bud burst and the leaf wilting symptoms after inoculation, probably determined by genetic differences among the elm tree progenies used. The treatments with salicylic acid, carvacrol and thymol induced the highest shift in phenolic metabolite profile with respect to control trees. The protective effect of carvacrol and salicylic acid is discussed in terms of their combined activity as antifungal compounds and as inductors of tree defence responses.

MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						Quiescence; Seed bank; Cooperation; Prisoner's dilemma	SEED BANK; SOCIAL EVOLUTION; SELECTION; DYNAMICS; ALTRUISM; GROWTH; MODEL	Despite the wealth of empirical and theoretical studies, the origin and maintenance of cooperation is still an evolutionary riddle. In this context, ecological life-history traits which affect the efficiency of selection may play a role despite being often ignored. We consider here species such as bacteria, fungi, invertebrates and plants which exhibit resting stages in the form of a quiescent state or a seed bank. When quiescent, individuals are inactive and reproduce upon activation, while under seed bank parents produce offspring remaining dormant for different amount of time. We assume weak frequency-dependent selection modeled using game-theory and the prisoner's dilemma (cooperation/defect) as payoff matrix. The cooperators and defectors are allowed to evolve different quiescence or dormancy times. By means of singular perturbation theory we reduce the model to a one-dimensional equation resembling the well known replicator equation, in which the gain functions are scaled with lumped parameters reflecting the time scale of the resting state of the cooperators and defectors. If both time scales are identical cooperation cannot persist in a homogeneous population. If, however, the time scale of the cooperator is distinctively different from that of the defector, cooperation may become a locally asymptotically stable strategy. Interestingly enough, in the seed bank case the cooperator needs to become active faster than the defector, while in the quiescent case the cooperator has to be slower. We use adaptive dynamics to identify situations where cooperation may evolve and form a convergent stable ESS. We conclude by highlighting the relevance of these results for many non-model species and the maintenance of cooperation in microbial, invertebrate or plant populations.

Seedlings of the susceptible (BRSMT-Pintado) and resistant (MG/BR 46 Conquista) soybean cultivars with 15 days of emergence were treated with Ecolife (R) (1.5 ml/L) or manganese phosphite (20 ml/L) at three different times: seven or one day prior to inoculation or seven days after inoculation with 2,000 eggs/plant. Untreated inoculated plants and untreated non-inoculated plants were used as controls. The number of galls, number of eggs/g root and vegetative parameters were evaluated 60 days after inoculation. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse over two different experimental periods. The results demonstrated that the commercial product Ecolife r reduced the number of eggs/g root, mainly in the susceptible cultivar treated seven and one day prior to inoculation. Manganese phosphite reduced the number of nematode eggs/g root when the resistant cultivar was treated seven days prior to inoculation, but only in Experiment 1. Neither of the two products enhanced plant development.

Root density, root volume and root length were monitored layer-wise from 0-180 cm rhizosphere in loamy-sand soil underlain with sandy-loam along with soil nitrate-N eluviation thrice, ie at vegetative (70 days), flowering (130 days) and harvest stages (160 days). The treatments consisted of 4 levels of N, viz 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg/ha, and 3 irrigation schedules, viz I1, 1 irrigation 4 weeks after sowing; I2, I1 + 1 irrigation at cumulative pan evaporation 120 mm, I3, I1 + 2 irrigations at cumulative pan evaporation 80 mm. The crop was sown on a well-charged root profile with pre-sowing irrigation of 8 cm. The root-growth parameters increased with an increase in N level (0-150 kg/ha) from early vegetative phase; culminating in higher N uptake (23-138 kg/ha); sizeable early build-up of above-ground plant infrastructure (2 400-8 890 kg/ha) and ultimately high seed yield (490-1 909 kg/ha). Irrigation effects differentiated from 130 days, with beneficial accruals of wet schedules on rooting capacity. Root length, however, showed no further beneficial effect beyond I2. Development of extensive root system helped the crop mop up and reutilize the eluviated nitrate-N from almost all the layers during later reproductive phase and thus accounting for very high efficiency of applied N by gobhi sarson. The significant interaction of N x irrigation for seed yield further emphasized that the presence of adequate moisture supply and high N fertilization, which promoted good root development, were also basic to high efficiency of applied N.

Nodulation, Nodule Growth and Proton Release by Soybean Plants Cultivated in Hydroaeroponic System as Affected by Salinity and Bradyrhizobium japonicum Strains	CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Bradyrhizobium japonicum; hydroaeroponic system; nodulation; salinity; soybean plants; proton		The present study aims to investigate the nodulation and nodule growth and proton release by soybean plants, Essor, inoculated with two strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, G49 and USDA122, tested for their salinity tolerance. The plants were cultivated in aerated saline solutions from the germination or 21 day after transplanting. By increasing salt concentrations, the strains were slowly grown. This effect was more obvious for strain USDA122 than G49 indicating that strain USDA122 was more sensitive to salts than the other one. Salt decreases the different parameters of plant growth. However, its effect was more pronounced in plants with early exposure to saline solutions. The nodule dry weight was the most affected. Nodule number was systematically less affected by salt than nodule mass. Plants inoculated with strain, G49 seem to be more tolerant than those inoculated with USDA122, especially for plants continuously growing in the high saline solution treatment. Salinity application significantly decreased the total proton release, whatever the strain used for inoculation. However, plants inoculated with strain G49 released more protons than those inoculated with the other bacterial strain. Increasing both of salinity concentration and time of application caused an increase in the values of specific proton release.	[Mohamed, Mohamed A.

Thyme was added to sucuk batter at the levels of 0, 1, 3 and 5%. Analyses were carried out on 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days of the ripening period. While the level of thyme did not have a significant effect (P > 0.05) on moisture, L(star) value, and lactic acid bacteria counts, it had a significant effect on + a(star) value (P < 0.01); and on pH, + b(star) value, and Micrococcus/Staphylococcus counts (P < 0.05). Ripening period had a significant effect (P < 0.01) on moisture, pH, L(star) and + b(star) values and lactic acid bacteria counts, and a significant effect (P < 0.05) on + a(star) value and Micrococcus/Staphylococcus counts of sucuk. Thyme was most effective when added to the sucuk batter at the level of 1%. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Plants are generally used in meat preparation and marinating. Thyme is one of the most commonly used one in Turkey. The addition of thyme to meat provides not only some advantages such as physical and microbiological properties but also production of new product in meat science.

This study employs a dual biomarker approach with stable isotopes and fatty acids to disentangle trophic interactions of Collembola in a plant-fungal soil system with maize (Zea mays) and the AM fungus Glomus mosseae. To separate ERM and root mediated effects, root (RC) and hyphal compartments (HC) were used, and the latter was spiked with labeled N-15 substrate. The euedaphic Collembola species Protaphorura fimata was introduced as the fungal and root grazer. Generally, the presence of Collembola in RC fostered biomass and phosphorous uptake in roots colonized with AM. Nitrogen transport from HC to RC was not altered, indicating that Collembola did not disrupt the ERM network via grazing. Collembola-fungus interactions fostered AM hyphal proliferation in HC, whereas in RC it induced a change from fungal senescence with build-up of storage reserves, to an active foraging phase. A distinct diet switch by Collembola between HC and RC indicated different ERM palatability meditated by the presence or absence of the host plant. Overall, Collembola grazing increased ERM nutrient sequestration, particularly phosphorus, and in turn plant performance. Collembola modified fungal phenology, favoring fungal colonization over reproductive phases. These trophic interactions were strongly determined by fungal life stage, with the establishment of a functional mycorrhiza as a crucial factor. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

We investigated the composition and co-variation of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities from two sorghum genotypes (BRS330 and SRN-39) in three different plant growth stages (emergence of the second leaf, (day10), vegetative to reproductive differentiation point (day 35), and at the last visible emerged leaf (day 50)) in two different soil types, Clue field (CF) and Vredepeel (VD). We observed that either bacterial or fungal community had its composition stronger influenced by soil followed by plant growth stage and cultivar. However, the influence of plant growth stage was higher on fungal community composition than on the bacterial community composition. Furthermore, we showed that sorghum rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities can affect each other's composition and structure. The decrease in relative abundance of the fungus genus Gibberella over plant growth stages was followed by decrease of the bacterial families Oxalobacteracea and Sphingobacteriacea. Although cultivar effect was not the major responsible for bacterial and fungal community composition, cultivar SRN-39 showed to promote a stronger co-variance between bacterial and fungal communities.

Using the molecular and genetic tools available for the unicellular fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and applying them to S. paradoxus, we tested the behavior of individual cells from sympatric woodland populations of both species for evidence of prezygotic isolation. First, we confirmed previous observations that vegetative cells of both species mate preferentially with S. cerevisiae. Next, we found evidence for mate discrimination in spores, the stage in which outcrossing opportunities are most likely to occur. There were significant differences in germination timing between the species: under the same conditions, S. paradoxus spores do not begin germinating until almost all S. cerevisiae spores have finished. When germination time was staggered, neither species discriminated against the other, suggesting that germination timing is responsible for the observed mate discrimination. Our results indicate that the mechanisms of allochronic isolation that are well known in plants and animals can also operate in sexual microbes.

However, the links between plants, microbes and nutrient cycling are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how plant identity and interspecific competition influence soil nitrogen cycling and attempted to link plant identity and interspecific competition to community structures of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP) of bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes. Faba bean and maize monocultures and a faba bean/maize mixture were planted with two nitrogen levels (0 and 100 mg N kg(-1) soil as urea). Soil mineral nitrogen, ammonia oxidizer function (potential nitrification activity, PNA) and community structures were measured 28 and 54 days after plant emergence. Faba bean and maize substantially differed in their influences on mineral nitrogen concentrations and PNA in rhizosphere soils. Soil mineral nitrogen and PNA in the rhizosphere soils of the faba bean/maize mixture were closer to those of the maize monoculture than to those of the faba bean monoculture. T-RFLP with restriction enzymes BsaJI and Hpy81 distinguished variations in bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers community structure, respectively, and detected both between-cluster and within-cluster variations in bacterial ammonia oxidizers. T-RFLP data showed that nitrogen addition favored part of a Nitrosospira cluster 3b sequence type and suppressed part of a cluster Nitrosospira 3a sequence type of bacterial ammonia oxidizers, while it had no influence on the archaeal ammonia oxidizer community structure. Although multivariate analysis showed that the function and community structure of bacterial ammonia oxidizers were significantly correlated, plant species and interspecific competition did not significantly change the community structure of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers. These results indicate that plant species and interspecific competition regulate soil nitrogen cycling via a mechanism of other than alteration in the community structure of ammonia oxidizers as investigated by DNA based methods.

Biota that how in the atmosphere range from very small (viruses, bacteria, pollen, and spores) to quite large (weed seeds, aphids, butterflies and moths, songbirds, and waterfowl). As these organisms move, they experience meteorological and ecological conditions that occur at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. We present an ecological scaling approach that integrates concepts and elements of spatial and temporal scaling to understanding aerobiology and provide examples of the ecological scales important to the long-distance aerial movement of organisms and associated biological events and processes. An operational framework for ecological scaling of long distance biota movement is achieved by linking spatially-static ecoregion classification systems with temporally-dynamic measures of vegetation phenology. The ecoregions provide ecological boundaries for the phenological dynamics of plants. Operationally, this approach integrates the bi-weekly vegetation greening indices (NDVI) derived from AVHRR or TM satellite data (representing temporal scaling) with the less dynamic land cover-land use classification (IGBP) and the relatively static ecoregion boundaries (representing the spatial scaling). We argue that the correlation of the life histories of species, especially the timing of take-off to ecosystem phenology through meteorological-based variables and indices (e.g., degree days and moisture indices), allows for dynamic characterization of source ecosystems and can be used to parameterize atmospheric models to forecast the flow of biota in the air. The scale of these processes, the diversity of the types of biota involved in long-distance movement, and the complexity of the processes require systems thinking. We anticipate that this paper will stimulate studies to enhance our understanding of the flow of organisms in the biosphere. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Soil pathogens could be an important mechanism of such noncompetitive distance and density-dependent (NCDD) mortality, but susceptibility to local pathogens may be ameliorated by a life history strategy that favors survivorship. In a shade-house experiment (1% full sun), we tested seedling life span, growth, and mass allocation responses to microbial extract filtered from conspecific-cultured soil in 21 tree species that varied in abundance and shade tolerance in a wet tropical forest (La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica). Forty-three percent of the species had significant reductions, and 10% of the species had significant increases in life span, growth, root length, or root surface area when inoculated with microbial extract; 10% of the species experienced opposing reductions and increases in these characteristics. Contrary to expectation, species' local abundance was not related to species-specific responses to microbial extracts from cultured soils. Across species, seedling shade tolerance (survival at 1% full sun) was negatively correlated with susceptibility to the microbial treatment for both survival and total mass accumulation, thereby exaggerating shade tolerance differences among species. Thus, soil pathogens may contribute to species coexistence through heightening niche differentiation rather than through negative density dependence in common species.

However, it is not known whether the loss of agrodiversity over recent decades has affected mycorrhizal populations, nutrient availability, and crop productivity. This study utilized linear mixed effect models to analyze the relationship between agrodiversity (three, six, and greater than or equal to eight cultivated species) and (a) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculum potential, measured as the most probable number (MPN) of propagules and colonization level, (b) nutrient availability, and (c) aboveground maize productivity. We also investigated the relationship between soil nutrient content and inoculum potential. Soil samples were taken before planting, and during flowering, in the 2009 maize cycle. We found that AMF colonization level of maize roots and P availability increased with planted species richness, but that this effect only occurred at the flowering sampling date. Plots with a higher MPN of propagules presented increased C and NO (3) (-) contents and lower C/N ratio than those with lower MPN of propagules, regardless of agrodiversity. Soils that produced the highest maize root colonization level also featured high P availability and N content. We conclude that decreased agrodiversity in these traditional systems does not significantly affect the soil MPN of propagules, but may have a negative impact on the ability of the mycorrhizal community to colonize maize roots, as well as reducing the availability of P, which is often the most limiting nutrient in tropical soils.

Merr	NEMATOLOGY			English	Article						marker-assisted selection; molecular markers; root-knot nematodes	ROOT-KNOT NEMATODE; PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES; SEQUENCE REPEAT MARKERS; JAVANICA	Host-plant resistance to Meloidogyne incognita race 2 is a useful and cost-effective tool for optimising soybean yield as well as profitability. Locally no nematicide is currently registered on soybean and most crops used in soybean-based rotations are also susceptible to M. incognita race 2. The identification of molecular markers and subsequent application of marker-assisted selection (MAS) is a quick and effective way to expedite a nematode resistance breeding programme. The soybean cultivars LS5995 (resistant) and Prima2000 (susceptible) were therefore used as parents in crosses to obtain a segregating F-2 mapping population for the identification of genetic markers linked to the resistance trait in LS5995. Inoculation with ca 10 000 M. incognita race 2 eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2) was performed 16 days after plant emergence. Subsequently, the F-2 population was screened with a number of SSR evenly distributed throughout the genome. A major QTL was identified on linkage group (LG) M between the markers Satt201 and Satt590 accounting for 62.4% of gall index values, while a QTL explaining 80% of the variation in eggs and J2 per root system in the segregating F-2 population is situated between Satt567 and Satt201. A minor QTL accounting for 37.1% of the variation in gall index values was identified between the markers Satt500 and Satt358 on LG-O and corresponds to a QTL for M. incognita race 3 resistance described in other publications. Presence of the abovementioned markers was confirmed in the progeny of a successive F-6 population, as well as in a number of exotic and local soybean genotypes. Meloidogyne incognita race 2 MAS could, therefore, be used in a breeding programme using markers Satt201, Satt358, Satt487 and Satt590, which were identified and validated in this study.

The full-length cDNA, designated as VpVTC, comprised 1943 bp and putatively encodes a 453-amino acid polypeptide containing an HIT motif. The deduced amino acid sequence showed high similarity with that of VTC genes from other plants. The expression of VpVTC, determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, was induced by E. necator and defense signaling molecules, including salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and ethephon, in 'Baihe-35-1', the V. quinquangularis genotype 'Shang-24', and the E. necator-susceptible V. pseudoreticulata genotype, 'Hunan-1'. Transcript levels of VpVTC correlated well with the degree of disease resistance in the 3 genotypes. Maximum induction of VpVTC by E. necator (>7-fold at 96 h post-inoculation) occurred in 'Baihe-35-1', which also showed the fastest response to signaling molecules. Upregulating the expression of VpVTC in 'Baihe-35-1' resulted in a gradual increase in the ascorbic acid concentration of leaves inoculated with E. necator. Furthermore, VpVTC was expressed in leaves, stems, inflorescence, tendrils, and fruit at all developmental stages, with the highest level occurring in fruit 35 days after flowering.	[Hou, H.

Interactions between microorganisms and plants have a major influence on the nutrition and health of the latter, and growth-promoting rhizobacteria can be used to improve plant development through a wide range of mechanisms. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate bacteria as growth-promoting agents for citrus rootstocks. A total of 30 bacterial isolates (11 of Bacillus spp., 11 actinobacteria, and 8 lactic acid bacteria) were evaluated in vitro for indoleacetic acid production, phosphate solubilization, and nitrogen (N) fixation. In vivo testing consisted of growth promotion trials of the bacterial isolates that yielded the best results on in vitro tests with three rootstocks: Swingle citrumelo [Citrus x paradisi Macfad cv. Duncan x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.], Sunki mandarin (Citrus sunki Hort. ex Tan), and rangpur (Citrus x limonia Osbeck). The parameters of interest were height, number of leaves, stem diameter, shoot and root dry mass, and total dry mass at 150 days after germination. The results showed that most bacterial isolates were capable of IAA production. Only one lactic acid bacterium isolate (BL06) solubilized phosphate, with a high solubilization index (PSI > 3). In the actinobacteria group, isolates ACT01 (PSI = 2.09) and ACT07 (PSI = 2.01) exhibited moderate phosphate-solubilizing properties. Of the Bacillus spp. isolates, only CPM06 and BM17 solubilized phosphate. The bacterial isolates that most fixated nitrogen were BM17, ACT11, and BL24. In the present study, some bacteria were able to promote growth of citrus rootstocks; however, this response was dependent on plant genotype and isolate. Bacillus spp. BM16 and CPM04 were able to promote growth of Swingle citrumelo. In Sunki mandarin plants, the best treatment results were obtained with BM17 (Bacillus sp.) and ACT11 (actinobacteria). For Rangpur lime rootstock, only BM05 (Bacillus sp.) was able to promote increase in two parameters assessed, height and number of leaves. When the bacterial isolates were used in mixture there was not promoted growth of plants on rootstocks. This fact may be associated with the different mechanisms of action of each bacteria involved or with the presence of competition among the microorganisms of the mixture. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

The first stage, which occurs immediately upon hydration of conidia and is characterized by relatively weak adhesive forces, appears to involve hydrophobic interactions (R. P. Doss, S. W. Potter, G. A. Chastagner, and J. K. Christian, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59:1786-1791, 1993). The second stage of adhesion, delayed adhesion, occurs after viable conidia have been incubated for several hours under conditions that promote germination. At this time, the germlings attach strongly to either hydrophobic or hydrophilic substrata. Delayed adhesion involves secretion of an ensheathing film that remains attached to the substratum upon physical removal of the germlings. This fungal sheath, which can be visualized by using interference-contrast light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, or atomic force microscopy, is 25 to 60 nm thick in the region immediately adjacent to the germ tubes. Germlings are resistant to removal by boiling or by treatment with a number of hydrolytic enzymes, 2.0 M periodic acid, or 1.0 M sulfuric acid. They are readily removed by brief exposure to 1.25 N NaOH. A base-soluble material that adheres to culture flask walls in short-term liquid cultures of B. cinerea is composed of glucose (about 30%), galactosamine (about 3%), and protein (30 to 44%).

This unusual liverwort is the only known parasitic seedless land plant with a completely nonphotosynthetic life history. The complete plastid genome of A. mirabilis was sequenced to examine the effect of its nonphotosynthetic life history on plastid genome content. Using a partial genomic fosmid library approach, the genome was sequenced and shown to be 108,007 bp with a structure typical of green plant plastids. Comparisons were made with the plastid genome of Marchantia polymorpha, the only other liverwort plastid sequence available. All ndh genes are either absent or pseudogenes. Five of 15 psb genes are pseudogenes, as are 2 of 6 psa genes and 2 of 6 pet genes. Pseudogenes of cysA, cysT, ccsA, and ycf3 were also detected. The remaining complement of genes present in M. polymorpha is present in the plastid of A. mirabilis with intact open reading frames. All pseudogenes and gene losses co-occur with losses detected in the plastid of the parasitic angiosperm Epifagus virginiana, though the latter has functional gene losses not found in A. mirabilis. The plastid genome sequence of A. mirabilis represents only the second liverwort, and first mycoheterotroph, to have its plastid genome sequenced. We observed a pattern of genome evolution congruent with functional gene tosses in parasitic angiosperms but suggest that its plastid genome represents a genome in the early stages of decay following the relaxation of selection pressures.

This relationship was investigated in terms of NH4+ supply and BNF by the two symbionts. Nodulated Phaseolus vulgaris seedlings with and without AM, were hydroponically grown with either 0 N or 1 mM NH4+ supply. Plants were harvested at 30 days after emergence and measurements were taken for biomass, N-2 fixation, photosynthesis, CO2 and O-2 root respiration, calculated C and N economy. AM roots had higher NH4+ uptake and this was associated with the suppression of BNF and nodule growth. The higher NH4+ uptake in AM roots occurred with lower root maintenance respiration, compared to when N was derived from BNF. There was also an increase in the below-ground sink strength of NH4+ fed AM roots compared to NH4+ fed non-AM roots, as evidenced by the increases in root CO2 and O-2 respiration and photosynthetic stimulation. These results indicate that although the AM root had higher total below-ground respiratory costs during NH4+ nutrition, there were lower respiratory C costs associated with N derived from AM symbionts in comparison to N from BNF.

R. Br.] collected in south Burkina Faso were evaluated to distinguish potentially different sources of resistance. Selfed (S1) plants were inoculated with isolates of Pyricularia grisea (Cooke) Sacc. (leaf spot), Puccinia substriata Ellis & Barth. var. indica (rust), and Moesziomyces penicillariae (Bref.) Vanky (smut) collected in Georgia. Height and flowering dates of greenhouse-grown S0 plants, S1 seed characteristics, and frequencies of chlorophyll-deficient S1 seedlings were evaluated. Among landraces, the frequency of plants resistant to Py. grisea ranged from 51.9 to 99.1% (xBAR = 82.5%). Frequencies of plants resistant to Pu. substriata ranged from 0 to 44.2% (xBAR = 10.1%). Differences in resistance to M. penicillariae existed among the landraces. Percent smutted florets ranged from 0.8 to 8.4% (xBAR = 4.2%). Seed set in the smut evaluation averaged 24.3% and was correlated with smut infection. In the greenhouse, S0 plant height and days to flowering averaged 2.3 m and 60.4 d, respectively. Seed color was generally light gray; seeds were typhoides shaped, with a mean 100-seed weight of 1.20 g. Five clusters of phenotypic diversity were identified among the landraces by principal component and cluster analyses, and several potentially different sources of disease resistance were identified. Nine pairs of the landraces and an additional landrace clustered with one of the pairs may be duplicate accessions.

Assessment of the contribution of microbial activities to tomato growth and yield under an organic production system	OPEN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Compost rates; Tomato varieties; Microbial populations; Microbial biomass; Enzyme activities	SOIL-MICROORGANISMS; CROP ROTATIONS; PLANT-MATERIAL; BIOMASS; MATTER; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT; MANURE; DECOMPOSITION; BIODIVERSITY	Optimizing microbiological activities in an organic crop production system is crucial to the realization of optimum growth and yield of the crops. Field and pot experiments were conducted to assess soil microbial activities, growth and yield of tomato varieties in response to 4 rates of composted plant and animal residues. The trials were carried out in the Federal University of agriculture, Abeokuta Nigeria, between April 2014 and November 2015. The compost rates were 0, 5, 10 and 20 t ha(-1), while the varieties used were Ibadan-improved and Ibadan-local. Fungi population, microbial biomass nitrogen and enzyme activities were significantly higher (P <= 0.05) at the rhizosphere of the local variety than that of the improved variety. This led to a significantly higher number of branches, plant height, leaf area, number of fruits and less days to maturity in the local variety. Also, growth parameters and tissue N significantly increased in all compost treatments while dry matter yield and weight of fruits were significantly higher in soil amended with 20 t ha(-1). Microbial activities correlated more significantly with growth and yield parameters at 6 weeks after transplanting. It was concluded that microbial activities could be optimized to improve the yield of tomato varieties in an organic production system, through the application of compost, particularly at 20 t ha(-1).

Ecotypes of Italian ryegrass from Swiss permanent meadows have often been used successfully as the base material of breeding programmes. However, their agronomic performance per se has never been studied in detail. Therefore, field trials were conducted to assess the potential of this semi-natural genetic resource for use in breeding. Twenty ecotype populations were collected in different geographical regions in 2003 and seed was increased. Plot trials with 20 ecotype populations were conducted 2005-2007 at three locations, supplemented by row trials at two additional locations, and including four currently recommended cultivars as controls. Average performance in terms of yield, vigour and resistance to snow mould of ecotypes was superior to the cultivars. Depending on the characteristic, between three and 16 of the 20 ecotypes performed significantly better than the cultivars mean. However, resistance against crown rust of all ecotypes was significantly poorer than that of the cultivars. Correlation and regression analysis showed that more eastern and more northern collecting sites harboured better performing ecotypes. However, the most consistent site related factor favouring performance of the ecotypes in terms of yield, vigour, snow mould and Xanthomonas resistance was a low abundance of species which are typical of Arrhenatheretum type meadows. Data from the plot trials were related to results obtained with spaced plants at a single site, either in a seedling nursery or in the greenhouse. Resistance against crown rust was extremely well predicted by spaced plant observations. Xanthomonas resistance observed after artificial inoculation in the greenhouse was also significantly, but less closely correlated with field observations. An early date of ear emergence as observed on spaced plants was associated with high annual yield in the plot trials. It is concluded that in intensively managed habitats, natural selection has resulted in ecotype populations of Italian ryegrass which are highly promising for use in breeding. Individual plant selection for resistance can be expected to efficiently reduce their high susceptibility to crown rust.	[Boller, Beat; Peter-Schmid, Madlaina K.

However, infection might also be associated with a cost to its host plant. We examined the distribution of Epichloe festucae infection in natural populations of three fescue grasses, Festuca rubra, F. ovina and F. vivipara, on mountains in northern Sweden to determine whether infection frequency varied with reindeer Rangifer tarandus grazing pressure and altitude. Two differently-scaled approaches were used: 1) infection frequency was measured at a local scale along ten elevational transects within a ca 400 km(2) area and 2) infection frequency was measured on a regional scale along elevational transects on 17 mountains classified as having a history of high or low reindeer grazing pressure. Mean infection frequencies in F. rubra were 10% (vegetative tillers at a local scale), and 23% (flowering culms at a regional scale), and in F. ovina they were 13% (local scale) and 15% (regional scale). Endophyte infection frequency in F. vivipara, was, on average, 12% (local scale) and 37% (regional scale). In F. rubra, infection decreased significantly with increasing altitude at both the local and regional scale, and was positively correlated with grazing pressure. In F. ovina, an opposite trend was found at the regional scale: infection frequency increased significantly with increasing altitude, while no discernible distribution pattern was observed at the local scale. No elevational trends were observed in infection of F. vivipara. These patterns in the distribution of endophyte-infected grasses in non-agricultural ecosystems may be explained by both biotic (grazing) and abiotic factors (altitude). Differences in ecology and life history of the studied grass species may also be of importance for the different results observed among species.

Detritivory facilitates herbivory in a freshwater system	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						detritivory; diet evolution; diet quality; fatty acids; freshwater herbivore; herbivory; structural equation model	FATTY-ACID CONTENT; PHOSPHORUS ENRICHMENT; NUTRITIONAL ECOLOGY; ENERGY RESERVES; FOOD QUALITY; EVOLUTION; ALGAL; DAPHNIA; MARINE; GROWTH	Herbivory is thought to be an inefficient diet, but it independently evolved from carnivorous ancestors in many metazoan groups, suggesting that plant-eating is adaptive in some circumstances. In this study, we tested two hypotheses to explain the adaptive evolution of herbivory: (i) the Heterotroph Facilitation hypothesis (herbivory is adaptive because herbivores supplement their diets with heterotrophic microbes); and (ii) the Lipid Allocation hypothesis (herbivory is adaptive because algae, which have high lipid concentrations, are nutritionally similar to carnivory). We tested these hypotheses using enclosure cages placed in the Everglades and stocked with Sailfin Mollies (Poecilia latipinna), a native herbivore. Using shading and phosphorus addition (P), we manipulated the heterotrophic microbe and lipid composition of colonizing epiphyton and examined the effects of varying food quality on Sailfin Molly life history. Epiphyton grown in shade only conditions had a 55% increase in bacterial fatty acids and 34% lower ratios of saturated+monounsaturated to polyunsaturated fatty acids relative to the other treatments. Ratio of autotroph to heterotroph biovolume varied throughout the experiment, with a 697% increase at 3weeks and 98% decrease at 6weeks compared to the other treatments. Gut contents revealed that fish fed selectively on epiphyton to compensate for apparent deficiencies in the available food. Fish raised in shade only cages experienced the highest survival, which was best explained by autotrophic biovolume and algal- and bacterial-derived fatty acids at 3weeks (2-6x more likely than alternative models with AICc>2.00), and by percentage of bacterial fatty acids in the diet at 6weeks (3-8x more likely than alternative models with AICc>2.00). There were no differences in fish growth among treatments. Autotrophic lipids play a role in early fish life history, but we did not find these to be the best predictors of life history later in the juvenile period. Instead, heterotrophic lipids facilitated the herbivorous diet and enhanced survival of juvenile fish in our experiment. Bacterial fatty acid content of the diet promoted herbivore survival, consistent with the Heterotroph Facilitation hypothesis. This is the first study to explicitly contrast Heterotrophic Facilitation and Lipid Allocation hypotheses for the adaptive evolution of herbivory in an aquatic system.

However, all statistical methods to date rely on a mathematical model built upon characteristics of hominid species. Namely, this model ignores specific ecological traits common to many plant, invertebrate, or fungal species such as self-fertilization and dormancy. The latter is defined as the ability of plant seeds or invertebrates to remain dormant for long periods of time in the soil or sediments. Here we develop a new statistical method which uses several whole genome sequence data per population/species to simultaneously infer 1) the rates of dormancy and of self-fertilization, and 2) past demographic history. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method using extensive simulations. We also apply our method to Arabidopsis thaliana confirming a high rate of selfing and the absence of long term seed dormancy, and to Daphnia Pulex demonstrating a long lived egg bank. We discuss the wide applicability of our method to draw accurate inference of past evolution for non-hominid species. Several methods based on the Sequential Markovian coalescence (SMC) have been developed that make use of genome sequence data to uncover population demographic history, which is of interest in its own right and is a key requirement to generate a null model for selection tests. While these methods can be applied to all possible kind of species, the underlying assumptions are sexual reproduction in each generation and non-overlapping generations. However, in many plants, invertebrates, fungi and other taxa, those assumptions are often violated due to different ecological and life history traits, such as self-fertilization or long term dormant structures (seed or egg-banking). We develop a novel SMC-based method to infer 1) the rates/parameters of dormancy and of self-fertilization, and 2) the populations' past demographic history. Using simulated data sets, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method for a wide range of demographic scenarios and for sequence lengths from one to 30 Mb using four sampled genomes. Finally, we apply our method to a Swedish and a German population of Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrating a selfing rate of ca. 0.87 and the absence of any detectable seed-bank. In contrast, we show that the water flea Daphnia pulex exhibits a long lived egg-bank of three to 18 generations. In conclusion, we here present a novel method to infer accurate demographies and life-history traits for species with selfing and/or seed/egg-banks. Finally, we provide recommendations for the use of SMC-based methods for non-model organisms, highlighting the importance of the per site and the effective ratios of recombination over mutation.

A range of spore germination temperatures as well as dew period durations and temperatures were investigated to determine some of the environmental requirements for disease establishment and disease progress. Plants were inoculated with urediniospores and exposed to dew periods between 3 to 12 h at temperatures of 10, 15, or 20 degrees C. For disease expression, the inoculated plants were then grown in a glasshouse at one of two temperature regimes (30/26 degrees C or 18/13 degrees C; day/night). Urediniospores germinated best at 12 +/- 1 degrees C, with lower germination rates at 5 degrees C or above 20 degrees C. No infection occurred when the plants were exposed to dew periods of less than or equal to 3 h, regardless of the incubation temperature. The disease progressed most rapidly when plants were inoculated and incubated for a dew period of at least 12 h at a temperature of 15 +/- 1 degrees C. The disease progressed most slowly following inoculation at dew periods of 6 h or less. Disease progress was more rapid when the plants were exposed to a cool-temperature regime (18/13 degrees C) than when exposed to a warm-temperature regime (30/26 degrees C). This suggests that good infection of parthenium weed could be obtained when the urediniospores arrive on the plants during the afternoon in the cooler months of the central Queensland autumn when relatively long dew periods are expected.

A field experiment was carried out at McGill University, Canada for three years (1987 to 1989) to test the effects of triadimefon (1-[4-chlorophenoxy]-3,3-dimethyl-1-[1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl]-2-butanone, or Bayleton, a trade name) fungicide (0 vs. 140 g a.i. ha-1) and row spacing (10 vs. 20 cm) on the yield components, yield and other agronomic traits (spike emergence, days to maturity, leaf disease and plant height) of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Cadette, Laurier and Leger. A cultivar by row spacing interaction resulted in a 11 to 13.5 % increase in grain yield due to narrow rows for Laurier in two out of the three years and up to 16 % for Leger in one year. Over the three years grain yields were on average increased 6 to 12 % due to use of the narrower row spacing. Fungicide application to barley at the early heading stage effectively controlled leaf diseases without influence on yield components or grain yield. Our results indicate that some components of intensive management such as narrow row spacing can be applicable in regions with a short crop-growing season.

The suite of factors that influence disease development is incompletely understood. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of pathogen population levels, crop residues, seed exudates, and their interactions on development of SDS and growth of F. virguliforme. Studies were conducted in a greenhouse with cultivars susceptible and partially resistant to SDS, four pathogen population levels, and six crop residue treatments (none; ground corn seed, stalks, and roots; ground soybean stems; and sorghum seed). Root rot was assessed 15 and 50 days after inoculation (dai) and foliar disease and plant biomass were assessed 50 dai. Population level increases and crop residues had significant interacting effects on increasing foliar disease severity and root rot and on biomass reduction. Disease severity was positively correlated with population and biomass was negatively correlated. Plants grown with no crop residues exhibited low or no root rot or foliar disease 15 dai, and severity was greatest with corn and sor-ghum seed. In vitro studies were conducted to test the effects of exudates collected from germinating soybean and corn seed on growth of F. virgu-lifonne and F. solani. Growth of these fungi was greater in exudates than in water. More growth occurred in exudates collected during soybean radicle emergence than those sampled at other times during germination. These studies show that pathogen population levels and crop-derived nutrients in soil interact and influence severity of SDS. Results have impli-cations for gaging disease risk and managing SDS.

For the isolation of interspecific hybrids the use of selection markers (kanamycin and hygromycin resistance) was useful but not essential. In this 2x + 2x interspecific combination 4x and 6x somatic hybrids were obtained. Seed set was the best in 4x x 4x (S. tuberosum) backcrosses, but seed germination was the best in 6x x 4x combinations, using in vitro germination of unripe seeds harvested 25 days after pollination. A high degree of pollen stainability (30-40%) was observed in 7 tetraploid hybrids and very low in all hexaploids. After iodine staining, the recessive amf marker was expressed by a red colour instead of blue, visible in starch-containing cells like columella cells of root tips, (micro)tubers or microspores. As expected, complementation was observed in starch-containing cells of the fusion hybrids. Segregation of the amf marker was clearly observed in microspores of 4x and 6x hybrids. Segregation ratios in the 4x hybrids showed variable recombination frequencies.

Ampelomyces spp., intracellular mycoparasites of powdery mildew fungi, which are themselves plant pathogens, are a useful model for studies of this issue. Ampelomyces is used for the biological control of mildew. Differences in mycohost phenology promote temporal isolation between sympatric Ampelomyces mycoparasites. Apple powdery mildew (APM) causes spring epidemics, whereas other powdery mildew species on plants other than apple cause epidemics later in the season. This has resulted in genetic differentiation between APM and non-APM strains. It is unclear whether there is genetic differentiation between non-APM Ampelomyces lineages due to their specialization on different mycohosts. We used microsatellites to address this question and found no significant differentiation between non-APM Ampelomyces strains from different mycohosts or host plants, but strong differentiation between APM and non-APM strains. A geographical structure was revealed in both groups, with differences between European countries, demonstrating restricted dispersal at the continent scale and a high resolution for our markers. We found footprints of recombination in both groups, possibly more frequent in the APM cluster. Overall, Ampelomyces thus appears to be one of the rare genuine generalist pathogenic fungi able to parasitize multiple hosts in natural populations. It is therefore an excellent model for studying the evolution of pathogens towards a generalist rather than host-specific strategy, particularly in light of the tritrophic interaction between Ampelomyces mycoparasites, their powdery mildew fungal hosts and the mildew host plants.

Cacique Gigante	BIOAGRO			Spanish	Article						Azospirillum; IAA; phosphate solubilization; rhizobia	AZOSPIRILLUM-BRASILENSE SM; SEED-GERMINATION; PLANT; BIOSYNTHESIS; INSIGHTS; STRESS	Inoculation with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) represents an alternative to increase the germination and improve the production of horticultural crops. In this study the effect of six rhizosphere bacterial isolates native to Merida, Venezuela was evaluated over the germination of bell pepper var. Cacique Gigante. Then, the best four isolates were selected to evaluate the effect on plant growth. A phosphate solubilization test was performed and the production of AIA was determined with three concentrations of tryptophan (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg.L-1). The germination test was performed in Petri dishes under aseptic conditions, inoculating the disinfected seeds with 108 UFC.mL(-1) of each strain at 28 degrees C in the dark. Growth was evaluated in vitro in MS medium with or without tryptophan (0.05 mg.L-1) at 25 degrees C with 16/8 hours light/dark. As a result, all strains solubilized Ca-3(PO4)(2), and the Leu2A(1)2, YAC1, Nod2R and ME01 rhizobacteria produced IAA, with and without tryptophan. Seeds that after storing had a viability decreased from 98 to 75 % were stimulated by the rhizobacteria, increasing germination 13-23 %. In addition, they accelerated in one day the maximum germination with respect to the control. After 55 days of growth, there were increases in length and dry weight of root and stem inoculated with YAC1 and Leu2A(1) 2, and with application of tryptophan. It was demonstrated that inoculation of bell pepper seeds with rhizobacteria, especially with Leu2A(1) 2, represents an alternative to increase germination and growth of the plant.

These different characteristics can influence the bacterial community inhabiting the rhizosphere niche that, in turn, influences plant growth and health. In this study, the bacterial community dynamics in the rhizosphere of maize and cowpea, in subsequent cultivation, were assessed using the 16S rRNA sequencing. Thus, during maize growth, soils were collected at 45 (flowering) and 75 (senescence) days. Afterward, during cowpea growth, the sampling occurred at 35 (flowering) and 65 (senescence) days. Our results showed differences between developmental stages within the same plant species. For maize, Acidobacteria decreased from flowering to senescence; while for cowpea, Proteobacteria, Armatimonadetes, WPS-2, and OP11 increased from flowering to senescence. Comparing the same developmental stage for both plant species, Proteobacteria, Elusimicrobia, WPS-2 decreased from maize flowering to cowpea flowering; while for the senescence stage, Acidobacteria, Armatimonadetes, and OP11 increased from maize to cowpea. Also, the rhizosphere community dynamic was more complex at the senescence stage compared to the flowering stage and bulk soil for both plants species. The results showed that the structure and diversity of bacterial community vary significantly according to plant species and, in a minor extent, their developmental stage. Also, we showed that the variation in rhizosphere activity during the plant growth could drive the responses of the bacterial community.

Non-fixing shrubs and trees of similar phenology to the Cyclopia species were chosen as reference plants. These reference plants were selected to cover a range of mycorrhizal associations (ericoid mycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal). Isotopic analysis revealed a wide range of foliar delta(15)N values for the reference plants, including many very negative values. The marked differences in delta(15)N values were defined by the mycorrhizal status of the reference plant species, with the ericoid and arbuscular mycorrhizal plants showing lower foliar delta(15)N values relative to their non-mycorrhizal counterparts. In contrast, the delta(15)N values of the N(2)-fixing Cyclopia species were uniformly clustered around zero, from -0.11parts per thousand to -1.43parts per thousand. These findings are consistent with the observation that mycorrhizal fungi discriminate against the heavier (15)N isotope during transfer of N from the fungus to the host plant, leaving the latter depleted in (15)N (i.e. with a more negative delta(15)N value). However, a major assumption of the (15)N natural abundance method for estimating N(2) fixation is that both legume and reference plant should have the same level of fractionation associated with N uptake. But, because mycorrhizal associations may strongly affect the level of fractionation during N uptake and transfer, the test legume should belong to the same mycorrhizal group as the chosen reference plant species. As shown in this study, if the mycorrhizal status of the legume and the reference plant differs, or cannot be assessed, then the (15)N natural abundance technique cannot be used to quantitatively estimate N(2) fixation.

Since in vivo production does not supply its demand, this investigation evaluated H. indica SL0708 production on different agar media. Five culture media (I, II, III, IV and V) were evaluated for productivity and pathogenicity of infective juveniles (IJs). IJs emerged between 11 and 16 days after inoculation in all media, with a total of 2.7 x 10(4) and 4.7 x 10(6) IJs produced during 15 days after IJs emergence, with maximum productivity at day five and high variability. Pathogenicity to Galleria mellonella larvae was not significantly different between in vitro and in vivo produced IJs on all media tested. Media IV and V were selected for their higher productivity. Subsequently, nematode inoculum size was evaluated in selected media at 2000, 4000 and 6000 IJs ml(-1), but significant differences were not observed in productivity and pathogenicity. Lastly, lipid source influence was evaluated in medium IV comparing canola, olive and soy oils. None of the plant-based oils had a significant effect on IJs production and pathogenicity. A medium was selected for H. indica SL0708 IJs production which was suitable in terms of productivity, culture time and pathogenicity of IJs produced. The medium and parameters selected in this study could be applied as an alternative for mass production of this entomopathogenic nematodes.

Population dynamics of indigenous endophytic bacteria in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. 'DES119') and sweet corn (Zea mays L. 'Silver Queen') stems and roots were studied in a 2-year field trial by quantifying culturable bacteria at intervals during the season on three media: R2A, medium SC, and tryptic soy agar. Population dynamics of endophytic bacteria inside cotton petioles and boils were also determined in 1 year. Endophytes were recovered from sweet corn roots and stems at seedling emergence at mean population densities of 4 log (colony-forming units per gram fresh weight (cfu/g-fw)) for both seasons, and were present throughout most of the growing season at populations ranging from 4 to 6 log(cfu/g-fw) in 1990 and 4 to 7 log(cfu/g-fw) in 1991. Endophytic bacteria were also present at emergence in cotton roots and stems in 1991 but were not detected until 2 days after emergence in 1990. Endophytic populations in cotton roots ranged from 4 to 6 log(cfu/g-fw) for most of the growing season in 1990 and 1991, while populations in cotton stems fluctuated between 3 and 7 log(cfu/g-fw) during both seasons. In cotton petioles, mean populations generally ranged from 1 to 4 log(cfu/g-fw), while no endophytic bacteria were recovered from bells (minimum detectable limit = 1.30 log(cfu/g-fw)). The relative contribution of seeds and soil as sources of endophytic bacteria recovered from inside plants was assessed using surface-disinfested seed in a potting mix or on water-agar. With sweet corn, the mean endophytic bacterial population in seedlings grown on water agar was below 2 log(cfu/g-fw), while with cotton the mean was 5 log(cfu/g-fw) 6 days after germination. Internal populations resulting from surface-disinfested seed planted in nonsterile potting mix were 6 log(cfu/g-fw) at 6 days after planting with corn but only 2 log(cfu/g-fw) with cotton. These results indicate that endophytic bacteria are natural inhabitants of internal regions of roots and stems and that the endophytes may arise from both seeds and soils.

This paper contains data from the pest risk assessment that was undertaken prior to release. It includes studies on the life-cycle, pathotype variation, infection parameters and host-specificity testing. Inoculation studies confirmed the rust to be microcyclic and autoecious. Seven pathotypes of the rust from six countries were assessed for variation in macroscopic morphology, phenology, and disease development on M. micrantha. The results conclude that two ecotypes can be identified, and that this could be linked to potential efficacy under different climatic conditions. A pathotype of P. spegazzinii from Trinidad (IMI 3930670) was selected for detailed assessment prior to release in the Western Ghats of Kerala State, south-west India. The rust was able to infect M. micrantha Lit temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 degrees C (optimum near to 18 degrees C) and also after less than 10 h of exposure to free-water oil the plant surface (optimum near to 15 h). More than 60 non-target plants were challenged with the rust, including I I other Mikania species. The rust was found to be highly specific within the genus Mikania; only three species from Africa and one from Asia became infected with the rust to varying degrees. Three other species, closely-related to M. micrantha, developed chlorotic spots in response to the rust; however, the symptoms progressed no further. The anticipated field efficacy of the rust in the invasive range of the plant is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Some studies have shown that ADOR negatively affects seed germination. However, to date, few studies have been carried out on the effect of ADOR on the oxidative stress of the plant. It is well known that saprobe fungi can detoxify these phenolic compounds and reduce the potential negative effects of ADOR on plants. To gain a better understanding of the phytotoxic effects and oxidative stress caused by this residue, tomato seeds were germinated in the presence of ADOR, treated and untreated with Coriolopsis rigida, Trametes versicolor, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Penicillium chrysogenum-10 saprobe fungi. ADOR sharply reduced tomato seed germination and also generated high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), O-2(-) and H2O2. However, bioremediated ADOR did not negatively affect germination and reduced MDA, O-2(-) and H2O2 content in different ways depending on the fungus used. In addition, the induced defense response was studied by analyzing the activity of both antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, ascorbate peroxidasa, glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidases and coniferil alcohol peroxidasa) and detoxification enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase (GST)). Our findings suggest that, because ADOR is capable of inducing oxidative stress, tomato seedlings trigger a defense response through SOD, CR. and GST activity and through antioxidant and lignification processes. On the other hand, the bioremediation of ADOR plays an important role in counteracting the oxidative stress induced by the untreated residue. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The importance of symbiotic dinitrogen (N-2) fixation in shaping the coupled nitrogen-carbon cycle is now known for most humid terrestrial ecosystems. However, whether N-2 fixation can play a key role in the nitrogen and carbon budget of water-limited and seasonally dry ecosystems remains a mystery. 2. The maintenance of metabolically and physiologically costly symbiotic fixation in water-limited environments is highly complex. These costs are particularly high during the first developmental season, when allocation to deep rooting and drought resistance mechanisms is essential for seedling survival of prolonged seasonal drought. 3. We, therefore, evaluated how drought-adapted legume species change their allocation to symbiotic nitrogen fixation as a function of soil nitrogen availability. We tested this on seedlings of a suite of four common Mediterranean legume shrubs with a strong seasonal behaviour, which we grew under controlled nitrogen and phosphorus availabilities. We asked: (1) Do species differ in their investment and regulation of nitrogen fixation? (2) Is fixation regulated via plant allocation to nodules, fixation rate or both? and (3) Does phosphorus availability limit symbiotic nitrogen fixation? 4. All Mediterranean perennial legumes in the experiment established and grew, nodulated, and fixed nitrogen, even under severe nitrogen limitation. The four species reacted similarly to nitrogen supply, by strongly downregulating fixation through both decreased nodulation and lower rate of fixation. However, we found a significant interspecific difference in fixation (both nodulation and rate), biomass production and growth rate. Our experimental species presented a range of fixation investment strategies corresponding to life-history and resource partitioning patterns. Phosphorus limitation had a minor influence on both fixation and plant growth. 5. Synthesis. The high physiological cost of symbiotic fixation imposes the need to tightly regulate fixation in perennial legumes coping with severe water stress. Control of fixation allows legume species to colonize recently disturbed nitrogen-deficient habitats, cope with grazing, survive long seasonal droughts and recover nitrogen fixation later in the wet season, and survive over time by reducing nitrogen inputs to the ecosystem.

Seasonal patterns of climate controls over nitrogen fixation by Alnus viridis subsp fruticosa in a secondary successional chronosequence in interior Alaska	ECOSCIENCE			English	Article						alder; boreal; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen fixation; succession	ARCTIC TUNDRA; WHITE SPRUCE; N-2 FIXATION; CARBON; FRANKIA; NODULATION; PHOSPHORUS; DYNAMICS; NUTRIENT; ALDER	Patterns of and controls over N-2 fixation by green alder were studied in post-fire, mid-succession, and white spruce upland forests in interior Alaska, focusing on the hypothesis that ecosystem-level nitrogen (N) inputs decrease with successional development. N-2-fixation rates tracked plant phenology during the 1997 (drought) and 1998 (normal precipitation) growing seasons. The best model for predicting acetylene reductase activity (ARA, mu mol C2H4 center dot g nodule(DWT)(-1 center dot)h(-1)) across all stands and sampling periods included a linear response to soil temperature and a quadratic response to Julian day (r(2) = 0.23, P < 0.0001). There were few significant relationships between seasonal maximum values for ARA and measured leaf traits; however, we did detect an inverse correlation between foliar N to P ratio and seasonal maximum ARA. During 1998, stands with higher maximum ARA had higher soil %N, and maximum ARA was positively correlated with subcanopy %P in O and A soil horizons. During 1997, leaf %P and N resorption were lower and leaves were thinner compared to 1998. Drought effects were most pronounced in mid-succession, where alder exhibited reduced ARA, leaf %P, leaf thickness, and lower leaf resorption of P and N. Although ARA and nodule biomass did not differ among stand types, increases in alder densities with successional time translated to increasing ecosystem-level N inputs across the chronosequence. These results contradict established theory predicting a decline in N-2-fixation rates and N-2-fixer abundance during successional stand development.

Long-term intervention measures to reduce Salmonella prevalence on tomatoes remain elusive for growing and postharvest environments. A naturally occurring bacterium identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Paenibacillus alvei was isolated epiphytically from plants native to the Virginia Eastern Shore tomato-growing region. After initial antimicrobial activity screening against Salmonella and 10 other bacterial pathogens associated with the human food supply, strain TS-15 was further used to challenge an attenuated strain of S. Newport on inoculated fruits, leaves, and blossoms of tomato plants in an insect-screened high tunnel with a split-plot design. Survival of Salmonella after inoculation was measured for groups with and those without the antagonist at days 0, 1, 2, and 3 and either day 5 for blossoms or day 6 for fruits and leaves. Strain TS-15 exhibited broad-range antimicrobial activity against both major food-borne pathogens and major bacterial phytopathogens of tomato. After P. alvei strain TS-15 was applied onto the fruits, leaves, and blossoms of tomato plants, the concentration of S. Newport declined significantly (P <= 0.05) compared with controls. Astonishingly,>90% of the plants had no detectable levels of Salmonella by day 5 for blossoms. The naturally occurring antagonist strain TS-15 is highly effective in reducing the carriage of Salmonella Newport on whole tomato plants. The application of P. alvei strain TS-15 is a promising approach for reducing the risk of Salmonella contamination during tomato production.

J	887		Andreu, AB; Caldiz, DO				Andreu, AB; Caldiz, DO			Early management of late blight (Phytophthora infestans) by using systemic fungicides applied to seed-potato tubers	CROP PROTECTION			English	Article						Solanum tuberosum; late blight; systemic fungicides; seed-tubers; foliage protection		Planting of seed tubers infected with late blight has been reported as a major cause in initiating the disease at field level. Seed treatments with contact fungicides can protect healthy tubers from infection during handling, grading and cutting before planting, but are not effective in protecting the young plant after emergence, when is more susceptible to the disease. Foliar fungicide applications are still required so crop protection early in the season, as a consequence of seed treatments could be an advantage especially in environments conducive to late blight epidemics. The systemic fungicides iprovalicarb+propineb (Melody Duo) and propyl carbarnate (Previcur N), from Bayer CropScience, were applied to seed potato tubers (40-50g) immediately after cutting or at planting to the bottom of the furrow and seed piece in cultivars Kennebec, Shepody, Ranger Russet, Russet Burbank and Spunta, at doses of 0.8 and 1.6kg ton(-1) and 0.4 and 0.81 ton(-1) of seed, respectively. Treated and control seed tubers were planted in pots in a greenhouse. From the time plants had one fully expanded leaf Lip to 40 days after emergence each treatment was evaluated by the detached-leaf method to assess foliage protection by means of artificial late blight inoculation. For all cultivars a higher level of foliage protection was found in those plants from seed tubers treated with iprovalicarb + propineb, while no effects were observed when the chemical was applied at planting to the bottom of the furrow. Used as described, this fungicide provided a higher protection against late blight than propyl carbarnate. Further pre-commercial field trials, carried Out during two growing seasons, with iprovalicarb+propineb was effective in protecting the foliage of cultivars Spunta, Kennebec and Shepody LIP to 4-6 weeks after crop emergence. For the first 4 weeks protection was high and the following two weeks it was satisfactory. This innovative application of iprovalicarb+propineb was only effective when the chemical was applied to cut seed tubers immediately after Cutting and before suberization. Due to its effectiveness in controlling late blight this type of treatment Should be part of a strategy for integrated late blight management, particularly where late blight epidemics occur early in the season.

(Merr.)). Analyses of variance indicated that most of the parameters measured were significantly (P >= 0.05) affected by the treatments. Accordingly, dual inoculation with TAL-378 and PSB significantly increased plant height at harvest, number of nodules per plant, nodule volume per plant, nodule fresh weight per plant, and shoot height at late flowering and early pod setting compared to the other treatments. Similarly, co-inoculation with TAL-378 and PSB, and dual fertilization of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers significantly increased number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod per plant and seed yield ha(-1) compared to the other treatments. Analysis of plant tissue also indicated that dual inoculation of TAL-379 and PSB yielded the highest total N whereas the lowest was recorded for the negative control. Likewise, dual inoculation with TAL-378 and PSB and the positive control gave the highest plant P compared to all other treatments. The data revealed that, there was no significant difference (P >= 0.05) in days required for emergence, flower bearing and maturity, number of seeds per pod, 300 seeds weight and root length among the investigated treatments. Thus, the dual inoculation of TAL-378 and PSB is recommended to achieve maximum seed yield of soybean in Assossa area.

Various concentrations of Matricaria chamomilla (M. chamomilla) flower extract was used for biosynthesis of Ag NPs with different sizes, 70 +/- 5 (Ag NP-1), 52 +/- 5 (Ag NP-i) and 37 +/- 4 nm (Ag NP-3), and size-specific antimicrobial activity of them was evaluated towards Gram + Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Gram Escherichia colt (E. colt) bacteria and Candida fungus albicans (C. albicans). We also examine the formation of Ag NPs as a function of the plant extract volume, Ag ion concentration (Ag+) and reaction time. M. chamomilla flower extract at 100 ppm shows mild inhibitory effect by inhibiting growth of all target pathogens. The extract mediated Ag NPs even at low concentration (6.25 ppm) caused reductions in cell densities of the pathogens. The potential reasons for the highly effective inhibitory activity of the extract mediated Ag NPs are: (1) synergistic effects due to combination of M. chamomile extract and Ag NP because Ag NP is an effective germicidal and M. chamomile plant itself shows mild inhibitory property, (2) high localized concentration of M. chamomile extract due to nano scale entrapment of it on surface of Ag NP and (3) size-specific antibacterial efficacy of Ag NP because small size increases the active surface area of Ag NP, which reacting bacterial cells and increases number of extract molecules anchored on the surface of Ag NP.

Research on resistance to FHB has mainly focused on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and is very limited in oat (Avena sativa L.). In Norway, routine testing of cultivars and breeding lines has been performed in spawn-inoculated field experiments with Fusarium graminearum Schwabe as part of a concerted research and breeding effort to improve FHB resistance in oat. Data on FHB symptom, days to flowering, and plant height have been collected during the field seasons. Together with the field data, deoxynivalenol (DON) content and germination capacity of harvested kernels are used to score resistance levels of genotypes. In this paper, results are presented from a combined analysis of data from 9 yr of field trials from 2008 to 2016. Consistent and highly significant differences in DON content and germination capacity were documented among the current oat cultivars on the Norwegian market. These two negatively correlated parameters are used as selection criteria in breeding since they are relevant for the different end uses of the grains: DON content for use as food and feed, and germination capacity for seed production. In the paper, we discuss the pros and cons of the various screening methods and parameters used in assessing FHB resistance in oat and present the progress made in resistance breeding based on an established field testing methodology.

This effect of NH (4) (+) supply was investigated with regards to the growth and function of the legume host and both symbionts. Nodulated Phaseolus vulgaris seedlings with and without AM, were grown in a sand medium with either 0 N, 1 mM or 3 mM NH (4) (+) . Plants were harvested at 30 days after emergence and measurements were taken for biomass, N-2 fixation, photosynthesis, asparagine concentration, construction costs and N nutrition. The addition of NH (4) (+) led to a decline in the percentage AM colonization and nodule dry weights, although AM colonization was affected to a lesser extent. NH (4) (+) supply also resulted in a decrease in the reliance on biological nitrogen fixation (BNF); however, the AM roots maintained higher levels of NH (4) (+) uptake than their non-AM counterparts. Furthermore, the non-AM plants had a higher production of asparagine than the AM plants. The inhibitory effects of NH (4) (+) on nodule function can be reduced by the presence of AM at moderate levels of NH (4) (+) (1 mM), via improving nodule growth or relieving the asparagine-induced inhibition of BNF.

Circle Valley, were investigated in glasshouse pot experiments. Systemically-infected plants from AMV-infected seed produced 21 % less shoot dry weight and accumulated 24 % less fixed nitrogen in shoots than healthy plants when harvested 53 d after germination. At day 75, infected plants showed similar shoot dry weight losses (22 %), but the quantity of nitrogen fixed fell by only 15 %. At day 53, soluble sugar, starch and bacteroid concentrations in nodules were unaffected by AMV infection, but nitrogenase specific activity was decreased by 25 % and soluble amino acids by 20 %. Although AMV infection resulted in no differences in the number of nodules formed in the first 11 d after germination or at any harvest thereafter, nodule mass was decreased by 23 % for virus-infected plants at day 53. However this difference disappeared by day 75. Growth of AMV-infected plants was decreased probably because of impaired N2 fixation with nodule function affected rather than nodulation. Increased nodule mass relative to plant weight in virus-infected plants, seen at day 75, implied some degree of compensation for the limitation in N2-fixing capacity. ELISAs for AMV antigen indicated that nodules were active sites of virus multiplication.

Seasonal patterns of high solar radiation regimes and extreme daily air temperatures thresholds were reflected in a high accumulation of heat from physiological maturity (2699 degrees D) until the end of reproduction season (4002 degrees D)). In treatments without chemical fertilization, low and intermediate P availability, the native AMFCag inoculum significantly increased Cag's relative growth rates and changed the biomass allometric allocation patterns causing a lower partition to the roots and a higher partition to the growth of shoots and photosynthetic assimilation surface. Depending on the phenological stage, the levels of P availability and the levels of native AMF propagules in the soil, significantly modified the content of C, H, S, P, N, Ca, Fe, Mn or Ni in the shoots. The native AMFCag inoculum significantly increased the functional colonization (Arum-Paris type) of roots except with higher P availability. However, when AMF propagules in the soil are low, P increase and presence of other mineral nutrients is detrimental to symbiotic establishment. Conversely, when AMF propagules in the soil are high, symbiotic traits indicate that the native AMF taxa tested, have different tolerance capabilities to colonize functionally the roots to obtain the carbon for their development even under a high P and other mineral nutrients availability in the soil. In extreme conditions of sunlight and air temperatures, Cag's phenological and ecophysiological traits were enhanced by the native AMFCag inoculum in different P availability levels, however, the mycorrhizal growth response decreased significantly as the availability of P increases, and the highest level of native AMF propagules in soil was the factor that promoted the increase of reproductive yield of Cag plants, not the increase of nutrients availability. This study provides novel information on AMF-Cag symbiotic interactions during plant development and phenological stages, as well as proposes different insights and hypothesis of research about Cag-AMF ecophysiology.

There is an increase of its cycle when altitude and latitude increase from the north to the south, decreasing in regions of lower altitude and when it moves from the south to the north; causing a limiting adaptation line. Because of that, this study aimed to evaluate semi early/medium cycle soybean genotypes in relation to their agronomic performance. The tests were settled in the experimental field in the Mato Grosso Federal University (UFMT), in Rondonopolis- MT. 27 soybean genotypes under the semi early/medium cycle were evaluated. The experiment was performed in duplicity, one of them subject to fungicide treatment and the other one to no randomized blocks design. The variables analyzed were: severity and Asian rust number of pustules cm(2), chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance, number of days for flowering, plant height under maturation, and insertion of the first pod, grain productivity, 100-grain weight, number of pod per plant, and grain per pod. Data were subject to analysis of variance by means of statistics program Sisvar, developed of Federal University of Lavras. The material UFUS 13 and witness UFUS Riqueza showed higher resistance to the pathogene, while genotype UFUS 02 scored higher in the characters plant height, insertion of the first pod, grain percentage and productivity.

Composting is an effective way to reduce the negative impact of antibiotics in manure on the growth of crops. In this paper, we have evaluated the effect of composting on the phytotoxicity of cow manure spiked with various concentrations of OTC (oxytetracycline) (50 mg kg -1, 150 mg kg -1 and 300 mg kg -1). Assessment of phytotoxicity was carried out using oat plants (Avena sativa L), by contact method on the 1st, 30th, 60th and 90th days of composting. Composts were mixed with soil in a ratio of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1. It was found that during the first 30 days, all composts had significant toxicity (the germination index did not exceed 10% for any mixtures). Afterwards, phytotoxicity decreased in all the mixtures. On the 60th day, the GI (germination index) ranged from 16.7% to 40.9%, with different OTC concentrations causing significantly differing effects. On the 90th day, the GI (germination index) ranged from 29.3% to 106.6%, with no significant difference observable in the samples with various initial concentrations of OTC. This may be due to decomposition of the antibiotic in the soil.

SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE			English	Article						Amaranthus tricolor L.; Agrobacterium rhizogenes; Rhizoclones; rolB gene amplification; Opine assay	RHIZOGENES-MEDIATED TRANSFORMATION; GENETIC-TRANSFORMATION; ROOT; INDUCTION; GROWTH	A protocol is developed for Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of Amaranthus tricolor via explain co-cultivation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes. Bacteria-plant specific factors which influenced transformation were optimized. Of the two Agrobacterium strains employed, LBA9402 was more infectious compared to A4. Bacterial suspensions grown overnight with 100 mu M acetosyringone and experiencing O.D-.660 = 0.6 followed by dilution to a density of 10(9) cells ml(-1) were the most effective. Explants from garden-grown plants were more responsive than those from in vitro cultures; stem internodes being better than leaves. Immersion of the pre-pricked explants in bacterial suspension resulted in a markedly higher transformation frequency compared to the direct injection method. The infection of internode explants with the LBA9402 strain followed by co-cultivation on growth regulator-free MS medium (MSO) for 5 days resulted in emergence of hairy roots up to a maximum frequency of 97.22%. Roots were individually cultured in MSO, but fortified with bactericidal antibiotic (500 mu g ml(-1) cefotaxime). Rhizoclones showing prolific growth were renewed through successive subcultures in MSO. Opine gene expression was revealed by positive agropine and mannopine synthesis in all selected transformed rhizoclones. Shoot regeneration from root clones, capable of auxin-independent growth and opine proficiency, was stimulated in MS augmented with 2.0 mg l(-1) zeatin. pRi TL-DNA rolB and pRi TR-DNA man2 ORF were detected in leaf tissues of regenerated plants from selected hairy root clones through PCR amplification. The implication of such findings is discussed on the possibility of conferring protection to crop amaranths against biotic stress challenges, particularly due to insects, viruses or fungal pathogens.

Seed characteristics and fungal pathogens affect seedling recruitment from soil seed banks. However, little is known about how grazing affects seed characteristics and fungal colonization on seeds. Seeds of L. davurica were obtained both from plants and from soil from plots where four intensities of grazing (0, 2.7, 5.3 and 8.7 sheep/ha) had been applied for 13 years. The morphological and germination characteristics and colonization of seed by fungi were examined. Seed size showed a hump-shaped trend with increasing grazing intensity. With freshly harvested seed, the intensity of 8.7 sheep/ha significantly enhanced germination and extended the time over which germination occurred. The occurrence of pathogenic Fusarium species on seeds decreased with increasing grazing intensity. Our study strongly suggests that the intensity of grazing can alter seed morphological and germination characteristics, as well as the colonization of fungi on seeds. Additional studies involving more members of the plant community are needed to determine whether the intensity of grazing results in a compensatory mechanism that serves to enhance the possibility of plant recruitment from seeds under field conditions.

Nitrogenase and reductase activities in a soil of high fertility	JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article							PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS L; RHIZOBIUM INOCULATION; DRY BEANS; FIXATION; STRAINS	Although common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) has a good potential for N-2 fixation, poor nodulation following inoculation, principally under field conditions, has led to increased nitrogen (N) fertilizer use in this crop. In the face of the negative environmental effects of N fertilizer, alternative methods have been studied to minimize the amount to be applied. In this sense, foliar application of molybdenum (Mo) has been cited as a promising method. Several papers show that high bean yields (1,500-2,500 kg ha(-1)), may be obtained in the southeasten region of Brazil, when there is an application of Nas side dressing or Mo spray 25 days after plant emergence. A field experiment was carried out to verify the effect of Mo foliar application on nitrogenase and nitrate reductase activities and on bean yield. Treatments included Rhizobium inoculation (with and without), foliar application of Mo (0 and 40 g ha(-1)), N at planting (0 and 20 kg ha(-1)) and N applied as side dressing (0 and 30 kg ha(-1)). Molybdenum and N as side dressing were used 25 days after plant emergence. Molybdenum increased greatly the nitrogenase activity and extended the period of high nitrate reductase activity, with a consequent increase in total shoot N. Increase of nitrogenase activity did not depend on inoculation, showing that soil native rhizobia may increase in effectiveness when appropriately handled. Bean yield did not differ significantly when fertilized with either Mo or N as side dressing.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the allelopathic effects of aqueous extracts of pine (Pinus sp.), millet [Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke] and velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum Piper & Tracy) on germination, mycorrhizal colonization and initial growth of corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L.) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Extracts of ground leaves were prepared. For the in vitro seven day- germination test, pH - neutral paper was previously wetted with the aqueous extracts or distilled water. The greenhouse experiment was arranged in a 3 x 3 x 4 factorial design, with four replications: three plant species (soybean, corn and bean), three aqueous extracts (Pinus, millet and velvet bean) and four extract doses (0.0; 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 kg L-1). A Red Latossol (Oxisol) collected in Selviria, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in the Cerrado biome was used as substrate. After sowing in pots, 50 mL of the aqueous extracts was applied every 5 days, during 45 days. Opposite to pine, extracts of velvet bean and millet reduced the hypocotyl and root length in soybean. In common bean, pine extract reduced hypocotyl and root length, contrasting to velvet bean and millet. Millet extract decreased the germination percentage and germination rate of beans. All plant extracts reduced mycorrhization and the number of spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on soybean, maize and common bean.

Two varieties (cv.NM 98 and cv.HCM 209) of mung bean were soaked in 10(-6) M ABA or in chlorocholine chloride and grown for five weeks under non-stress conditions after which water stress was imposed at 50% flowering (37 days after sowing). Drought stress reduced fresh and dry weight of root and shoot,decreased the diameter of pink bacteroid tissue and number of root nodules. However, ABA and CCC pre-soaking treatments partially alleviated the inhibitory effect of drought. Pre-soaking with ABA or CCC in non-stressed or stressed plants caused increase in proline, protein, sugar and chlorophyll content and peroxidase activity of leaves. However, ABA treatment caused a maximal increase in proline accumulation while maximal increase in peroxidase activity was observed in plants raised from seeds treated with CCC. Likewise, endogenous levels of phytohormones GA and IAA were also increased following ABA application. whereas, CCC increased IAA. Maintenance of water budget by increase ill relative water content of leaves,greater increase in proline production, higher activity of antioxidant enzyme, peroxidae and better survival of Rhizobium in soil following ABA and CCC application appears to be the mechanism for providing mung bean tolerance to water stress. The effects of CCC was similar to ABA under water stress and may be implicated to combat water stress on farmers level because of better cost benefit ratio as compared to ABA.

Patterns and mechanisms of conspecific and heterospecific interactions in a dry perennial grassland	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						coexistence; competition; competitive hierarchy; facilitation; germination; intraspecific vs; interspecific interactions; plant-soil feedbacks	PLANT-SOIL FEEDBACK; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; COMMUNITY; FACILITATION; RECRUITMENT; COEXISTENCE; EMERGENCE; GROWTH; CONSEQUENCES; CONTINGENCY	P>1. Models of local stable coexistence require negative feedbacks, i.e. intraspecific interactions must be more negative than interspecific interactions. However, most competition experiments, often done in the glasshouse, have found evidence for competitive hierarchies. Measurement of interactions under realistic field conditions is necessary to assess their contribution to community dynamics, and explicit measurement of intermediaries thought to be important in interactions may allow studies to account for any variation in experimental results. 2. In this study, we compare conspecific and heterospecific interactions in a field experiment in a dry sand prairie in Michigan. We study the four dominant species at two different stages, germination and adult growth. Using seed addition and adult transplant experiments, we ask whether plants perform best in natural field monocultures of conspecifics, heterospecifics or no neighbour plots. We also measure abiotic environmental characteristics associated with each neighbourhood type and test whether performance can be explained by environmental effects. We hypothesize that plants will create competitive hierarchies because our experimental design is similar to classic competition experiments. 3. Neighbour species created consistent hierarchies in their effects on germination of all four target species, which is likely due to light limitation. However, interestingly, adult plant biomass for two of the three species (one species did not survive) was lower in conspecific monocultures compared to heterospecific or no neighbour plots, thus producing negative feedbacks. For two species, the effects of neighbours on adult growth are likely due to reduction of light and soil nitrate; for the third, however, resources could not explain the pattern that conspecific interactions were more negative than heterospecific. 4. Synthesis. These results suggest that patterns in the relative strength of conspecific and heterospecific competition depend on life-history stage. Moreover, resource uptake could explain some, but not all, of the interactions among species, suggesting that other factors such as microbial communities or other forms of niche partitioning may play a role and that field experiments are necessary to gauge their relative importance.

Earlier snowmelt accompanied by warmer soil temperatures in mid-latitude aspen forest and subalpine meadow: Implications for soil carbon	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Microbial biomass; Snowmelt; Dissolved organic carbon; Soil carbon; Soil respiration; Subalpine	MICROBIAL BIOMASS; MINERALIZATION RESPONSES; GROWING-SEASON; ORGANIC-CARBON; WATER-CONTENT; RESPIRATION; CLIMATE; DECOMPOSITION; NITROGEN; WINTER	An advance in snowmelt timing in seasonally snow covered ecosystems has a wide range of potential impacts on plant and soil processes. Plants may respond to earlier melt through changes in phenology and altered allocation of resources to growth and reproduction, and earlier snowmelt may impact active pools of soil C such as microbial biomass and dissolved organic C (DOC). In subalpine aspen forests and open meadows in the Wasatch Plateau of the western Rocky Mountains, we manipulated snowmelt timing by adding dust to the snow surface. We obtained a treatment-induced snow-free interval of 6 to 22 days (3% to 11% reduction in snow-covered days). We observed the growth of early and mid-season herbaceous species, measuring above ground biomass, flower and seed counts, and seed mass. We also monitored microbial biomass, DOC, and soil respiration in the days and weeks following snowmelt. We observed generally warmer soil temperatures in the early snowmelt plots compared to controls. However, we found no difference in microbial biomass C or DOC following snowmelt and we found no legacy effect in growing season soil respiration as a result of earlier snowmelt. After three years of repeated treatments, total soil organic C remained unchanged between treatment and control plots. Although earlier snowmelt is likely to have a variety of impacts on subalpine ecosystems, we found no change in plant biomass or reproductive allocation and we found that carbon pools and fluxes were not perturbed by earlier snowmelt. A common expectation is that earlier snowmelt will lead to more frequent freeze-thaw cycles in soils, and studies have shown that freeze-thaw events can have significant but temporary impacts on soil C efflux. This study indicates that subalpine plants and soils may be at least partially buffered from some of the anticipated effects of earlier snowmelt. One direction of continuing research may be to identify adaptive buffers in subalpine ecosystems, an understanding of which may be useful in anticipating and responding to future climate change.

However, after the emergence of several outbreaks of foodborne diseases some concerns regarding the microbiological safety of fresh strawberries have increased in recent years. In this paper new insights, based on application of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) as alternative to chemical fungicides in the fields for preharvest preservation of strawberries are presented. Antifungal activity of ZnO NPs was tested on main strawberry plant pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Obtained data indicated that used ZnO NPs (5 x 10(-3) M) in the dark just insignificantly (12%) inhibited the radial growth of B. cinerea. But photoactivated ZnO NPs (5 x 10(-3) M, 405 nm, 34 J/cm(2)) inhibited the growth of B. cinera by 80%. Real-time field experiments revelead, that spraying of ZnO NPs in the strawberry field in sunny day reduced Botrytis incidences by 43%, enhanced the crop production by 28.5% and stoped the spoilage of harvested fruits during storage by 8 days, if compare with control. No harm to crowns and leaves of strawberry plant have been found, however this treatment increased the growth of inflorescence (37.5%) and reduced the growth of runners (32.8%). For comparison, spraying of conventionqal chemical fungicide fenhexamid (FEN) reduced Botrytis incidences in the same level as ZnO NPs, increased the harvest by 21.9% and delayed the spoilage of fruits by 8 days. The presented results look highly promising, since ZnO NPs in the presence of sunlight, activated by UV and visible light can protect strawberry fruits from Botrytis infection more effectively than conventional fungicide fenhexamid. This treatment significantly increased crop production and reduced spoilage of strawberries. It looks like ZnO NPs have great potential in the future to replace chemical fungicides.

Using AMF inoculum to improve the nutritional status of Prunella vulgaris plants in green roof substrate during establishment	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING			English	Article						Green roof; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); Inoculum; Substrate; Phosphorous	ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; SOIL; PHOSPHORUS; GROWTH; COLONIZATION; DIVERSITY; REPRODUCTION; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; BENEFITS	Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to improve the growth, health, nutrient uptake, flowering and drought tolerance of many terrestrial plant species. Green roofs are generally deficient in nutrients, organic matter and water, and-therefore AMF could be extremely beneficial in improving green roof plant performance. Despite this there is a lack of empirical research into artificially introducing AMF into green roof substrates. In this study, a commercial AMF inoculum was applied to Prunella vulgaris green roof plugs grown in small modules on a flat roof in Sheffield, UK. The modules were filled with commercial green roof substrate (80% small particle sized crushed brick, 20% green waste compost) to a depth of 100 mm. AMF inoculum was applied as four treatments: (i) directly with plug, (ii) mixed evenly into surrounding substrate, (iii) split between plug and substrate, (iv) control treatment with no inoculum added. Significantly greater levels of AMF colonisation of P. vulgaris roots was detected in all AMF treatments compared to the control. Low levels of AMP colonisation of P. vulgaris roots were also observed in the control treatment, confirming that low levels of AMP inoculum were present in this commercial substrate. Shoot phosphorous (P) concentration was improved in all AMF treatments, however there was no significant effect of any AMF treatment on P. vulgaris growth rate or biomass production. The highest AMF colonisation of P. vulgaris roots was observed when AMP inoculum was directly added to just the plug. Promisingly, P. vulgaris flowering time at the end of the first growing season was also extended in the plug AMP treatment only. This study has confirmed that commercial AMP inoculum can be used to successfully colonise plants and introduce AMP networks into green roof substrate. Although AMP inoculum was naturally present in the substrate used in this study, levels were extremely low, and unlikely to have any significant effect on plants. This study indicates that care should be taken in the use of AMF inoculum on green roofs, as the growth and health benefits of AMF are not always immediately apparent for green roof plants. In addition much more research is required in order to fully assess the extent of the benefits of AMF on green roof plants and to determine if their use can be financially viable.

Common bean genotypes, APN18, BAT271, PVA846, POT51, G2633 and G12168, were grown in an aerated N-free nutrient solution at low (72 mu mol plant(-1) week(-1)) and control P supplies (360 mu mol plant(-1) week(-1)). Nitrogenase activity was estimated by in situ measurements of acetylene reduction activity (ARA) in a flow-through system. During the assays, maximum values of ARA (peak ARA) were reached between 20 and 30 min after exposure to C2H2, depending on P treatment and growth stage. Thereafter, a decline in C2H4 evolution was observed. This decline was most pronounced in low-P plants and there was a significant genotypic effect. ARA per plant was decreased by P deficiency, mostly because nodulation was delayed and the number and mass of nodules were reduced. The ARA decrease during pod filling was also activated by P deficiency. ARA per g dry weight nodule was increased by P deficiency in G2633 and G12168, unchanged in APN18, BAT271 and POT51 and decreased in PVA846. Except for the climbing type IV G2633, total N at harvest for all P treatments was correlated with the cumulative value of peak ARA and with peak ARA at early pod-filling which was the highest peak ARA throughout the growth cycle of type III bushy genotypes. We conclude that if phenology and growth habit are carefully considered, peak ARA is a reliable screen of genotypes for N-2 fixation tolerance to P deficiency. Selection of lines with early nodulation under P deficiency is also advisable, and the effect of P deficiency on the nodule functioning needs to be considered.

The rhizobia studied: UFRGS Om57; UFRGS Om59 and UFRGS Om148, obtained from the collection of cultures of UFRGS Soil Microbiology Laboratory, the isolated adesmia EEL46210, donated by Epagri, and SEMIA929 and SEMIA6437 strains, released by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) for the production of inoculants for Ornithopus micrantus and Adesmia latifolia. In the experiments with each species of plant, in addition to the inoculated treatments, two control treatments without inoculation were conducted, one with the adding of nitrogen N dose equivalent to 100 kg N. ha(-1) and the other with a dose equivalent to 50 kg N. ha(-1). The study was arranged in a completely randomized design and lasted 45 days. The isolated UFGRS Os57, UFRGS Om148, EEL46.210, SEMIA929 and SEMIA6437 stimulate root dry mass of sudan grass. Isolated UFRGS Om57 induces higher plant height compared to Control N - at 15 and 30 days after emergence. In millet, the SEMIA 929 strain increased the shoot and root dry mass, height at 15 days, and the Relative Efficiency Ratio (RER%) is more than 150%. The inoculation with UFRGS Om57 isolate stimulates sorghum shoot and root dry mass. For this treatment the RER% is 179%.

In the present investigation, we sought to determine whether, inoculation with B. subtilis could alleviate the adverse effects on promotion wheat plant growth. Two wheat cultivars (Triticum asitivum L.) nominated (Beni Suef and Salambo) were grown up to ninety days after germination as B. subtilis treated and control. Seven different yield related traits were investigated as plant growth detectors. The traits were, plant height (P.H.), number of tillers (N.T.), shoot fresh weight (S.F.W.), number Leaves of plant (N.L.P.), total root length (T.R.L.), weight of the youngest elongate blade leaf (Y.E.B.) and number spikes of plant (N.S.P). The results indicated that all the aforementioned yield related traits were increased with different proportions as response for root inoculation with B. subtilis as compared to the non-inoculated plants of the two cultivars. These results reflected the great effects of root inoculation with B. subtilis on wheat plant growth and productivity. The performances of (CDPKs), (PEPCs) and (P5CS) genes expression were evaluated via semi quantitative RT-PCR. The results confirmed that wheat root inoculation with B. subtilis led to increasing gene expression compare to the non-inoculated ones. We postulate that the present investigation provides a more robust topology of the root inoculation with B. subtilis and its ability to prompting some important genes to improve productivity in wheat plant.

The control of this disease has been accomplished with uncontrolled applications of chemical fungicides causing problems for humans and environment. The present work had the objective to compare the effect of natural extracts on the control of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp tracheiphlum, originated from seeds of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L), compared to chemical fungicide effect. Extracts of Allium sativum, Anadenanthera colubrine, and Ocimum basilicum were used alone or in combination with Mancozeb. A 50 mu L aliquot of each treatment was added in a hole (6 mm of diameter) made in the center of Petri dishes with BDA and a fungus mycelia disk was inoculated on it. Evaluations were done during seven days, measuring the pathogen mycelial growth. Seeds of cowpea were disinfected with sodium hypochlorite, sowed in plastic bags with autoclaved soil. Eight days after germination, wounds were made on the basal part of the plantlets, and fungus spore suspension (1.4 x 10(-5) con/mL) was applied on it. Evaluations of the disease severity were accomplished daily during 30 days after inoculation, using a disease index. Combination of extracts of A. sativum + Ocimum basilicum and Anadenanthera colubrina + Ocimum basilicum did not reduce fungus mycelial growth, whereas Ocimum basilicum extract alone showed minor mycelial growth, indicating fungicide action of this treatment on F. oxysporum f. sp tracheipphlum under the conditions studied. Combination of Mancozeb + Anadenanthera colubrina was responsible for lower average of severity on the evaluated plants.

Mycorrhizal symbiosis affects ABA metabolism during berry ripening in Vitis vinifera L. cv.

Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine if the ability of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to enhance phenolic content (specifically, anthocyanins) in a climate change framework could be mediated by alterations in berry ABA metabolism during ripening. The study was carried out on fruit-bearing cuttings of cv. Tempranillo (CL-1048 and CL-1089) inoculated ( + M) or not (-M) with AMF. Two experimental designs were implemented. In the first experiment +M and -M plants were subjected to two temperatures (24/ 14 degrees C or 28/18 degrees C (day/night)) from fruit set to berry maturity. In the second experiment, +M and -M plants were subjected to two temperatures (24/14 degrees C or 28/18 degrees C (day/night)) combined with two irrigation regimes (late water deficit (LD) and full irrigation (FI). At 28/18 degrees C AMF contributed to an increase in berry anthocyanins and modulated ABA metabolism, leading to higher ABA-GE and 7'OH-ABA and lower phaseic acid (PA) in berries compared to -M plants. Under the most stressful scenario (LD and 28/18 degrees C), at harvest +M plants exhibited higher berry anthocyanins and 7'OH-ABA and lower PA and dihydrophaseic acid (DPA) levels than -M plants. These findings highlight the involvement of ABA metabolism into the ability of AMF to improve some traits involved in the quality of grapes under global warming scenarios.

Influence of inoculation with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on tomato plant growth and nematode reproduction under greenhouse conditions	SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						PGPR; Meloidogyne; Biological control; Rhizobacteria; Pseudomonas	INDUCED SYSTEMIC RESISTANCE; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; PSEUDOMONAS; BIOCONTROL; RHIZOSPHERE; POPULATIONS; DISEASES	Numerous species of soil bacteria which flourish in the rhizosphere of plants or around plant tissues stimulate plant growth and reduce nematode population by antagonistic behavior. These bacteria are collectively known as PGPR (plant growth promoting rhizobacteria). The effects of six isolates of PGPR Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus, were studied on tomato plant growth and root knot nematode reproduction after 45 days from nematode infection. The highest number of shoot dry weight/g (43.00 g) was detected in the plant treated with S. marcescens; then P. putida (34.33 g), B. amyloliquefaciens (31.66 g), P. fluorescens (30.0 g), B. subtilis (29.0 g), B. cereus (27.0 g) and nematode alone (untreated) 20 g/plant. While the highest number of plant height was observed when plant was treated with S. marcescens, P. fluorescens, P. putida, B. amyloliquefaciens and P. putida 52.66, 50.66, 48 and 48 cm respectively. No significant differences were seen between previous treatments but only had significant differences compared with untreated plant. The highest number of fruit/plant was observed when plants were treated with S. marcescens (10.66), then B. amyloliquefaciens (8.66), P. putida (8), P. fluorescens (8) and B. cereus (7.66). No significant differences between the last 4 treatments, but all had significant differences compared with untreated plants. The highest weight of plant yield (g) was observed with S. marcescens (319.6 g/plant) and the lowest weight of plant yield was observed in plants treated with nematode alone (untreated). On the other hand, the lowest numbers of J(2)/10 g of soil (78), galls/root, (24.33) galls/root, egg masses/root (12.66) and egg/egg masses were observed in the plants treated with S. marcescens.

These wild relatives are either not easily crossable and produces sterile F-1 when crossed with cultivated genotypes. The present study was executed with the objective of standardization of protocol and obtaining hybrids of Solanum melongena and Solanum khasianum through embryo rescue technique. The cross pollination between indegenous colloections of S. melongena and locally collected S. khasianum was carried out in a reciprocal manner. Out of 25 indegenous genotypes, IC 203585, IC 261767, IC 261797, IC 305129, IC 354611, IC 099736 and IC 261888 showed good fruit setting when S. khasianum was used as male. However, no fruit setting was observed when S. khasianum used as female parent and most of the fruits dropped within 35 days after pollination. The hybrid combinations, viz. IC 203585 x S. khasianum, IC 261767 x S. khasianum, IC 261797 x S. khasianum and IC 305129 x S. khasianum gave the best results when inoculated after 25 days after inoculation. Maximum shoot regeneration was observed to the tune of 80.01 +/- A 0.108 in IC 261797 x S. khasianum when inoculated on MS media supplemented with 2 mg/l BAP + 0.5 mg/l IAA. However, the highest root regeneration was observed in IC 203585 x S. khasianum to the extent of 78.45 when inoculated on media MS + 2.5 mg/l kinetin + 1 mg/l IAA.

Inhibition of Fusarium culmorum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhizoctonia solani by n-hexane extracts of three plant species as a wood-treated oil fungicide	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						citrus; fungal degradation; GC/MS analysis; n-hexane extracts; wood biofungicide	VITEX-AGNUS-CASTUS; IN-VITRO ANTIBACTERIAL; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; ANTIFUNGAL ACTIVITY; ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY; EUCALYPTUS-CAMALDULENSIS; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; NATURAL EXTRACTS; PARALOID B-72	Aims: Wood as a packing tool is used for packaging and transportation of fruits and vegetables for a time period varying from hours to days. During transportation, fruits and vegetables can be affected by moulds with significant postharvest problems. The present study describes the possibility of using wood-treated oil fungicide of n-hexane extracts from Eucalyptus camaldulensis (aerial parts), Vitex agenus-castus (leaves) and Matricaria chamomilla (flowers) against the infestation of Fusarium culmorum, Rhizoctonia solani and Penicillium chrysogenum. Methods and Results: Air-dried wood samples of Melia azedarach were prepared with the dimensions of 0.5 x 1 x 2 cm and treated with the oily extracts at the concentrations of 0, 1, 2 and 3%. Oils extracted with n-hexane from E. camaldulensis and V. agenus-castus showed promising antifungal activities against the isolated and molecularly identified three fungi F. culmorum, R. solani and P. chrysogenum, while M. chamomilla observed the lowest activity against the studied fungi. GC/MS analysis of oils reported that the major components in E. camaldulensis were beta-fenchol (25.51%), Cyclobuta[1,2:3,4]dicyclooctene-1,7(2H,6bH)-dione,dodecahydro,(6 alpha beta,6 beta alpha,12 alpha alpha,12 beta beta)- (17.05), 1,8-cineole (eucalyptol) (12.01%) and sabinene (9.45%); in V. agenus-castus were eucalyptol (22.17%), (E)-beta-caryophyllene (18.39%), and beta-sitosterol (12.44%); while in M. chamomilla were bisabolol oxide A (27.87%), (Z)-beta-farnesene (16.11%), D-limonene (14.18%) and chamazulene (11.27%). Conclusions: The results suggest using n-hexane oily extracts from E. camaldulensis and V. agenus-castus as a biofungicide for wood protection. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study highlights the importance of using bio-friendly fungicide agents to protect wood against most common moulds occurring during handling of food packaging.

The reduction was evident in induced plants challenged at 7 and 14 days after induction of leaf 1 but was not observed when leaves were challenged at 2 1 and 28 days after induction. Germination of conidia and appressorial formation were not significantly different on the induced and non-induced plants. Removal of inducer leaf 1, 7 days after inoculation with C. lagenarium, did not significantly reduce the inhibition of penetration or persistence of inhibition as compared to plants with the inducer leaf attached. High peroxidase and chitinase activities were evident in the induced leaves 21 and 28 days after the induction, although no restriction of fungal penetration was apparent. Removal of inducer leaf 1 at 7 days after inoculation reduced the activities of peroxidase peroxidase and chitinase at 14, 21 and 28 days after induction. Though peroxidase and chitinase activities increased in leaves 2 and 3 between 7 and 28 days after the induction of leaf 1, the induced resistance against the fungus decreased. The data from this investigation suggest that the reduction of fungal development in induced plants results from at least two different mechanisms. One reduces penetration into the plant and the other restricts development of the fungus once it has penetrated. The reduction of induced resistance al times when peroxidase and chitinase activities are high also suggests that the activities of these enzymes at the time of challenge are not major factors for the restriction of C. lagenarium in induced cucumber plants.

Milk from two groups of farms that mainly differ in their level of intensification of dairy cow and forage area management was processed into cheese in the same Cantal dairy plant, during 4 periods of 3 consecutive days each. The milk chemical composition differed little between the two producing groups whereas the differences were greater between the processing periods because of the combined effects of the season, the mean lactation stage of the herds and cow feeding. Major chemical and microbiological differences were noted in ripened cheeses according to the cheesemaking period, especially between cheeses made in the winter and in the summer. The cheesemaking period and ripening time (6, 13 and 23 weeks) accounted for most of the variance noted in all the sensory characteristics of the cheeses, whereas the production system had a far lesser impact. With regards to odour and aroma, the spring and winter cheeses differed from the autumn and summer ones. With time, the cheeses became softer and melted more and tasted saltier and more pungent. The stronger characteristics were enhanced whereas milder flavours lost power, a trend that was more marked in the winter cheeses. On average, the cheeses made from the more extensive farms were more elastic and slightly less bitter and pungent. They were also characterised by their globally less intense odour and aroma characteristics. The differences between the two production systems were noticeable in cheeses made in the winter or spring and the most significant after 13 weeks of ripening. For other periods or other ripening time, the cheeses made from the 2 groups of farms were very close.

However, despite global increases in the inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to ecosystems due to human activities, we lack a predictive understanding of how microbial communities respond to elevated nutrient inputs across environmental gradients. Here we used high-throughput sequencing of marker genes to elucidate the responses of soil fungal, archaeal, and bacterial communities using an N and P addition experiment replicated at 25 globally distributed grassland sites. We also sequenced metagenomes from a subset of the sites to determine how the functional attributes of bacterial communities change in response to elevated nutrients. Despite strong compositional differences across sites, microbial communities shifted in a consistent manner with N or P additions, and the magnitude of these shifts was related to the magnitude of plant community responses to nutrient inputs. Mycorrhizal fungi and methanogenic archaea decreased in relative abundance with nutrient additions, as did the relative abundances of oligotrophic bacterial taxa. The metagenomic data provided additional evidence for this shift in bacterial life history strategies because nutrient additions decreased the average genome sizes of the bacterial community members and elicited changes in the relative abundances of representative functional genes. Our results suggest that elevated N and P inputs lead to predictable shifts in the taxonomic and functional traits of soil microbial communities, including increases in the relative abundances of faster-growing, copiotrophic bacterial taxa, with these shifts likely to impact belowground ecosystems worldwide.

Assessment of climate change effects on mountain ecosystems through a cross-site analysis in the Alps and Apennines	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Long-term research; Climate change; Vascular plants; Freshwater; Soil; Snow cover	SWISS ALPS; PLANT DIVERSITY; ALPINE LAKES; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; VASCULAR PLANTS; EUROPEAN ALPS; SNOW-COVER; VEGETATION; COMMUNITIES	Mountain ecosystems are sensitive and reliable indicators of climate change. Long-term studies may be extremely useful in assessing the responses of high-elevation ecosystems to climate change and other anthropogenic drivers from a broad ecological perspective. Mountain research sites within the LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) network are representative of various types of ecosystems and span a wide bioclimatic and elevational range. Here, we present a synthesis and a review of the main results from ecological studies in mountain ecosystems at 20 LTER sites in Italy, Switzerland and Austria covering in most cases more than two decades of observations. We analyzed a set of key climate parameters, such as temperature and snow cover duration, in relation to vascular plant species composition, plant traits, abundance patterns, pedoclimate, nutrient dynamics in soils and water, phenology and composition of freshwater biota. The overall results highlight the rapid response of mountain ecosystems to climate change, with site-specific characteristics and rates. As temperatures increased, vegetation cover in alpine and subalpine summits increased as well. Years with limited snow cover duration caused an increase in soil temperature and microbial biomass during the growing season. Effects on freshwater ecosystems were also observed, in terms of increases in solutes, decreases in nitrates and changes in plankton phenology and benthos communities. This work highlights the importance of comparing and integrating long-term ecological data collected in different ecosystems for a more comprehensive overview of the ecological effects of climate change. Nevertheless, there is a need for (i) adopting co-located monitoring site networks to improve our ability to obtain sound results from cross-site analysis, (ii) carrying out further studies, in particular short-term analyses with fine spatial and temporal resolutions to improve our understanding of responses to extreme events, and (iii) increasing comparability and standardizing protocols across networks to distinguish local patterns from global patterns.

Seeds of the hybrid AZ 41801 were inoculated with teliospores impregnated using as adherents: 1% (w/v) sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) 1%, ADH (R), 2% (w/v) sodium alginate 2%, 50% (w/v) brown sugar 50% (w/v), 2% (w/v) agar - agar, 10% (w/v) grenetin and a treatment 1: 200 (v/v) of inoculum: soil 1: 200 (v/v). Treated seeds were planted in a greenhouse in 40 x 40 cm polyethylene pots with sterile soil. In 2015, grenetin as adherent, induced 96.3% of diseased plants in greenhouse. Morphological and molecular characterization of the pathogen was carried out before the inoculation and after the final evaluation. This method of inoculation was evaluated in 2016 in field conditions in Mixquiahuala, Hgo. A total of 160 lines C2-S3 from a bmaize population improvement program were inoculated with teliospores of S. reilianum f. sp. zeae using 10% grenetin as adherent. The incidence of the disease in both experiments planted in 2015 and 2016 was evaluated 45 days after flowering, with direct observation of symptoms and signs in male and female inflorescences. One line showed 54.5% of infection. The hybrid AZ 41801 reached 70.7% of diseased plants. It is suggested to use 10% grenetin as adherent in the inoculation of maize seeds with teliospores of S. reilianum f. sp. zeae for the selection of disease resistant germplasm.

The application of a novel fumigation agent based on ammonium bicarbonate to the soil as a strategy for controlling Fusarium wilt and its effects on soil microflora was investigated in a field with serious disease incidence in this study. Overall, the results showed that fumigation effectively controlled cucumber Fusarium wilt disease and significantly increased the total and mean cucumber fruit weight. Real-Time PCR results showed that the total bacterial and fungal numbers in the treatment (LAB) significantly decreased after fumigation and that significantly fewer fungi were observed after harvest (LABOF). The next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes using MiSeq platform showed that the soil bacterial and fungal community structures in the fumigation treatment were significantly different from the control without fumigation regardless after fumigation or harvest. Compared to the control, higher abundances of Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia and Zygomycota, and lower abundance of Ascomycota were observed in the fumigated soils after fumigation and harvest. Furthermore, the abundances of Mortierella and Gp1 were significantly higher. Most importantly, the abundance of Fusarium, which includes the pathogen potentially responsible for cucumber Fusarium wilt disease, was significantly lower in the fumigated soils after harvest. Redundancy analysis showed that the fumigated soils were dominated by Ohtaekwangia, Gp6, and Gp4, which were related to the soil total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) contents. In addition, Penicillium and Pseudaleuria fungi were dominant in the treatment and control, and the control was dominated by Fusarium. In conclusion, the observed disease suppression due to the novel ecological soil fumigation strategy may be attributed to general suppression resulting from altered soil properties, such as higher soil NH4-N, NO3-N and TON contents, and the alteration of the disturbed soil microflora in a cucumber monoculture system.

Life History Responses and Gene Expression Profiles of the Nematode Pristionchus pacificus Cultured on Cryptococcus Yeasts	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; PLASTICITY; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; BIOLOGY; SYSTEM; MODEL	Nematodes, the earth's most abundant metazoa are found in all ecosystems. In order to survive in diverse environments, they have evolved distinct feeding strategies and they can use different food sources. While some nematodes are specialists, including parasites of plants and animals, others such as Pristionchus pacificus are omnivorous feeders, which can live on a diet of bacteria, protozoans, fungi or yeast. In the wild, P. pacificus is often found in a necromenic association with beetles and is known to be able to feed on a variety of microbes as well as on nematode prey. However, in laboratory studies Escherichia coli OP50 has been used as standard food source, similar to investigations in Caenorhabditis elegans and it is unclear to what extent this biases the obtained results and how relevant findings are in real nature. To gain first insight into the variation in traits induced by a non-bacterial food source, we study Pristionchus- fungi interactions under laboratory conditions. After screening different yeast strains, we were able to maintain P. pacificus for at least 50- 60 generations on Cryptococcus albidus and Cryptococcus curvatus. We describe life history traits of P. pacificus on both yeast strains, including developmental timing, survival and brood size. Despite a slight developmental delay and problems to digest yeast cells, which are both reflected at a transcriptomic level, all analyses support the potential of Cryptococcus strains as food source for P. pacificus. In summary, our work establishes two Cryptococcus strains as alternative food source for P. pacificus and shows change in various developmental, physiological and morphological traits, including the transcriptomic profiles.

The treatments were: 1) control with water (CTL); 2) fertilized (F); 3) inoculated with AMF (M); 4) with vermicompost aquose extract (LV); 5) inoculated with AMF and fertilized (M+F); 6) fertilized and with vermicompost aquose extract (LV+F); 7) inoculated with AMF, and treated with vermicompost aquose extract (M+LV); 8) inoculated with AMF, fertilized and treated with vermicompost aquose extract (M+F+LV). The evaluated parameters were: color, weight, polar and equatorial diameter, firmness, Brix, proximal analysis, phenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins contents. LV and M treatments promoted a significant increase of fruit weight (39%) compared to the fertilized treatment. In general, treatments with AMF increased ash except when combined with fertilization. The M treatment caused a significant increase of ash (3.7%) respect to the F treatment. The treatments containing AMF and LV (alone or combined with others) increased fat content in fruits, in comparison with the F treatment. There were no significant effects treatments on fiber content. Fruits from plants treated with LV+F were significantly firmer (20%) than fruits in the F treatment. Fruits in the M+F treatment showed the higher values of degrees Brix (14% higher than fruits in the F treatment). Interestingly, fruits from the treatments LV and M+F had significantly superior contents of total phenols than fruits from the F treatment (29 and 17% respectively). In general, the treatments containing AMF and LV promoted flavonoides accumulations in fruits. Fruits of the M treatment showed a significantly greater content of this pigments (1.8 times) than fruits of the F treatment. Fruits of the M+VL treatment showed the highest anthocyanins content, being 38% greater than that found in fruits of the F treatment. Results showed that the application of AMF and LV influenced sensorial and nutraceutical fruit quality attributes in strawberry.

Biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions in an organic farmscape	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agrobiodiversity; Ecosystem services; Landscape ecology; Multifunctionality; Organic farming; Partial canonical correspondence analysis; Tradeoff analysis	FIELD MARGINS; EARTHWORM POPULATIONS; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; HEDGEROW NETWORKS; FARMING SYSTEMS; BETA-DIVERSITY; LAND-USE; SOIL	To increase ecosystem services provided by their lands, farmers in the United States are managing non-production areas to create a more biodiverse set of habitats and greater landscape heterogeneity. Relatively little is known, however, of the actual environmental outcomes of this practice, termed 'farmscaping'. We inventoried communities of plant and soil organisms and monitored indicators of ecosystem functions in six distinct habitats of an organic farm in California's Central Valley to better understand the ecological costs and benefits of farmscaping. A riparian corridor, hedgerows, a system of drainage ditches, and tailwater ponds supported different plant life history/functional groups and greater native plant diversity than the two production fields. Differences were less pronounced for belowground organisms, i.e., nematode functional groups, microbial communities (based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis) and earthworm taxa. Partial ordination analysis showed that environmental variables, rather than spatial location, explained much of the distribution of soil and plant taxa across the farmscape. Riparian and hedgerow habitats with woody vegetation stored 18% of the farmscape's total carbon (C), despite occupying only 6% of the total area. Infiltration rates in the riparian corridor were >230% higher than those observed in the production fields, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solution were as much as 65% higher. The tailwater pond reduced total suspended solids in irrigation runoff by 97%. Drainage ditches had the highest N2O-N emissions (mean values of 16.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and nitrate (NO3--N) leaching (12.1 g m(-2) year(-1) at 75 cm depth). Emissions of N2O-N and leaching of NO3--N were, however, quite low for all the habitats. Non-production habitats increased biodiversity (particularly plants) and specific ecosystem functions (e.g. water regulation and carbon storage). Extrapolating relative tradeoffs to the entire farmscape showed that greater habitat enhancement through farmscaping could increase both biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions of agricultural lands with minor loss of production area.

In these, bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) was spread from infector plants to test rows by naturally occurring aphids. The numbers of clover plants developing BYMV symptoms in each row were counted at different times. Based on the results from at least 2 field experiments, different genotypes were assigned to 1 of 5 BYMV infection categories (A-E), ranging from greatest (A) to least (E) infection. Category A was found to contain genotypes that were latest maturing while, except for cv. Rosedale (ssp. brachycalycinum) which was in E despite being of intermediate maturity, category E contained earliest maturing genotypes. Except for cv. Rosedale, when the percentages of plants with BYMV symptoms in the 3 main experiments were plotted against days to flowering previously established for each genotype, the two were closely related. However, when young plants of cultivars in categories D or E were aphid-inoculated with 2 BYMV isolates! they became infected to a similar extent to young plants of 2 late-maturing cultivars from category A. This suggests that, except for cv. Rosedale, the extent of BYMV infection obtained in the field was determined by plant physiological age, plants of late-maturing genotypes being easier for viruliferous aphids to infect with BYMV than plants of early-maturing genotypes of the same age but physiologically older, a phenomenon known as 'mature plant resistance'. When plants of cv. Rosedale were aphid-inoculated with 7 different isolates of BYMV, a systemic hypersensitive reaction developed with 5 isolates but not with two others. This suggests that cv. Rosedale has 'strain specific hypersensitive resistance' to BYMV. No systemic hypersensitive reaction developed when the same 7 BYMV isolates were aphid-inoculated to cv. Dwalganup and named selections Pink Flowered and Northam Early, genotypes previously reported to react hypersensitively to potyvirus infection. The field screening procedure employed is suitable for use by T. subterraneum breeding programs seeking to develop new cultivars with resistance to BYMV. Cultivar Rosedale may prove a suitable source of resistance to use as a parent in crossing programs aimed at producing cultivars with natural BYMV resistance.

The experimental design was a randomised complete block design with eight treatments replicated four times. Significant differences were observed in total plant dry weight by the different treatments in pure stands. 21 days after emergence with higher values under mixed cropping system in common beans. However, at 42 days after emergence, plant dry weights in uninoculated common bean pure stands with N application were significantly higher than under other treatments. Common bean yields were significantly reduced by the maize intercrop. The inoculated common bean and N application treatment recorded the largest seed dry weights and subsequently yields per hectare. These findings suggest that intercropping common beans and maize considerably suppresses the yield of the former under the semi-arid conditions of south-east Kenya. Inoculation of common bean with the commercially available Rhizobium strain 446 on the other hand was effective and improved yields. Soil analysis of the experimental plots before and after one cropping season indicated that common beans increased N slightly or maintained it at the pre-planting levels. This was unlike the pure maize plots where there was a marked decline in soil N. There was however, a marked increase in soil phosphorus in all treatment plots. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Each substance was tested separately, using two concentrations (9 g kg(-1) and 18 g kg(-1)). The experiment was conducted in four replications (four pots with five plants in each pot per treatment). Plants were cultivated in both control and contaminated soils. After six weeks from soil contamination and five weeks from sowing the seeds, observations of the effect of petroleum-derived substances on traits of three successive generations of aphids were conducted. Aphids were inoculated separately on leaves using cylindrical cages hermetically closed on both sides. Contamination of aphid occurred through its host plant. Results showed that all tested substances adversely affected A. fabae life history traits and population dynamics: extension of the prereproductive period, reduction of fecundity and life span, reduction of the population intrinsic growth rate. In broad bean, leaf, roots, and shoot growth was also impaired in most conditions, whereas nutrient and heavy metal content varied according to substances, their concentration, as well as plant part analysed. Results indicate that soil contamination with petroleum-derived substances entails far-reaching changes not only in organisms directly exposed to these pollutants (plants), but also indirectly in herbivores (aphids) and consequently provides information about potential negative effects on further links of the food chain, i.e., for predators and parasitoids.

V. Tieghem produces a woodrose type haustoriurn on host trees. In some rural areas of southern Africa woodroses are harvested for their unique ornateness and prepared for sale as curies. Concern for the sustainability of mistletoe populations led to this study. Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst hosts were artificially inoculated with hand-excised mistletoe seeds and post-harvest recovery of mistletoes on 12 S. birrea trees were investigated a year after disinfection. E. dregei exhibited 25% germination after 5 days but no seedlings survived a month in the field. Seventy-eight living E. dregei removed in 1994 were replaced one year later by 68 'new' plants probably through resprouting from internal, longitudinal cortical strands which allow for rapid vegetative recovery after removal. Poor seedling establishment and the occurrence of new recruits on branches between 0.0002 to 0.025 m(2) cross-sectional area could indicate resprouting rather than recruitment from seed. The growth rates of 22 E. dregei woodroses growing on S. birrea were assessed over a 12 month period during 1994/5. These woodroses varied in size from seedlings to individuals with a diameter of 25 cm. Absolute growth rate increased linearly with woodrose size, with most growth occurring during the first 6 months (August-February) relative to the second (February-August). Relative growth rates declined (negative In function) from very high rates for very small woodroses to fairly similar slow rates of growth for all other sizes. Woodroses of diameter 10 cm and 25 cm are typical size classes sold as curies. Using the growth data, it is estimated that woodroses of these sizes are 40 +/- 25 (S.D.) and 56 +/- 35 years old respectively. These slow rates of growth must be taken into consideration when determining sustainable harvesting limits.

Moench) have been developed. These fines are adapted to regions located at an altitude of 2200 m, and when they are sown at lower altitudes, they present early flowering and high pollen fertility. These two characteristics could help to reduce the damage caused by the Claviceps africana Frederickson, Mantle & de Milliano fungus, responsible of the ergot, cornezuelo, or sugary disease. In Celaya, Guanajuato, Mexico (1560 m altitude), an experiment was established in order to evaluate days to flower, panicle length, flowering period, number of tillers, and seed yield, (seed number and size) of three male-sterile A lines, inoculated with the pathogen at flowering, and pollinated at different times. An incomplete block design with split plots treatments arrangement with four replications, was used. The treatments in main plots were the lines (A LIVA X -cold-tolerant-, ATx 630, and ATx 631), and in the split plots, seven times of pollination (one row per time). Before flowering, the main panicle of 10 fully competitive plants per row was covered. At the flowering onset, the panicles were uncovered and sprayed with 5 mL of a 1 X 10(4) conidia mL(-1), suspension, and covered again. Pollination took place at the following times: T1=half an hour after inoculation; T2 to T5=one, two, three, or four days afterwards, and T6=without pollination (control only inoculated). The panicles corresponding to TO were not inoculated, but only pollinated at the same time as T1. The respective fertility maintainer lines (lines B) were sown in edge rows, in order to use them as a source of pollen and to determine in them the total number of seeds per panicle and the percentage of fertile pollen. The cold-tolerant A line turned out (p <= 50.05) to be the earliest one, with a larger number of seeds per panicle and higher yield, shorter flowering period, and fewer tillers than the other two lines. The cold-tolerant B line showed higher percentage of fertile pollen (91%) than BTx 630 (79%) and BTx 631 (69%). As pollinating delayed, ergot damage in seed yield and seed number was greater (p:50.05), but ATx 630 and ATx 631, pollinated half an hour after inoculation, reduced their yield by 41% on average, whereas the cold-tolerant line reduced it by only 28%. The potential of cold-tolerant germplasm as a source of morphological and physiological traits allowing sorghum plants to reduce the damage caused by this fungus, is confirmed.

The relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down control of population dynamics has been the focus of much debate. In infectious disease biology, research is typically focused on the bottom-up process of host resistance, wherein the direction of control flows from the lower to the higher trophic level to impact on pathogen population size and epidemiology. However, the importance of top-down control by a pathogen's natural enemies has been mostly overlooked. 2. Here, we explore the effects of, and interaction between, host genotype (i.e., genetic susceptibility to pathogen infection) and infection by a hyperparasitic fungus, Ampelomyces spp., on the establishment and early epidemic growth and transmission of a powdery mildew plant pathogen (Podosphaera plantaginis). We used a semi-natural field experiment to contrast the impacts of hyperparasite infection, host-plant resistance and spatial structure to reveal the key factors that determine pathogen spread. We then used a laboratory-based inoculation approach to test whether the field experiment results hold across multiple pathogen-host genetic combinations and to explore hyperparasite effects on the pathogen's later life-history stages. 3. We found that hyperparasite infection had a negligible effect on within-host infection development and between-host spread of the pathogen during the onset of epidemics. In contrast, host-plant resistance was the major determinant of whether plants became infected, and host genotype and proximity to an infection source determined infection severity. 4. Our laboratory study showed that, while the interaction between host and pathogen genotypes was the key determinant of infection outcome, hyperparasitism did, on average, reduce the severity of infection. Moreover, hyperparasite infection negatively influenced the production of the pathogen's overwintering structures. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that bottom-up host resistance affects pathogen spread, but top-down control of powdery mildew pathogens is likely more effective against later life-history stages. Further, while hyperparasitism in this system can reduce early pathogen growth under stable laboratory conditions, this effect is not detectable in a semi-natural environment. Considering the effects of hyperparasites at multiple points in pathogen's life history will be important when considering hyperparasite-derived biocontrol measures in other natural and agricultural systems.

However, in many cases, the environmental drivers are poorly understood. To identify and rank the drivers currently causing broad-scale floristic changes in N Europe, we analysed data from two vascular plant surveys of 200 randomly selected 2.5 x 2.5 km grid-squares in Scania, southernmost Sweden, conducted 1989-2006 and 2008-2015, respectively, and related the change in frequency (performance) of the species to a wide range of species-specific plant traits. We chose traits representing all plausible drivers of recent floristic changes: climatic change (northern distribution limit, flowering time), land-use change (light requirement, response to grazing/mowing,response to soil disturbance), drainage (water requirement), acidification (pH optimum), nitrogen deposition and eutrophication (N requirement, N fixation ability, carnivory, parasitism, mycorrhizal associations), pollinator decline (mode of reproduction) and changes in CO2 levels (photosynthetic pathway). Our results suggest that climate warming and changes in land-use were the main drivers of changes in the flora during the last decades. Climate warming appeared as the most influential driver, with northern distribution limit explaining 30%-60% of the variance in the GLMM models. However, the relative importance of the drivers differed among habitat types, with grassland species being affected the most by cessation of grazing/mowing and species of ruderal habitats by on-going concentration of both agriculture and human population to the most productive soils. For wetland species, only pH optimum was significantly related to species performance, possibly an effect of the increasing humification of acidic water bodies. An observed relative decline of mycorrhizal species may possibly be explained by decreasing nitrogen deposition resulting in less competition for phosphorus. We found no effect of shortage or decline of pollinating lepidopterans and bees.

Comparison of the non-native herb Alliaria petiolata with dominant native herbs in microhabitats of a Midwestern forest	ECOSPHERE			English	Article						Alliaria petiolata; community ecology; competition; driver-passenger; fitness difference; forest ecology; herb layer; invasion biology; niche difference; phenology; regeneration; traits	WHITE-TAILED DEER; GARLIC MUSTARD; INVASIVE PLANT; COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; BIOLOGICAL INVASION; BRASSICACEAE; ECOSYSTEM; IMPACT; LIGHT	A mechanistic understanding of the causes of naturalization in terrestrial plant communities, and the consequences for associated ecosystems, relies on understanding whether and how native and non-native plant traits differ. Traits of non-native plants may either help them compete or avoid competition with natives, and depending on their interaction with the native community, the non-native may act as more or less of an active driver vs. a passive passenger of change in the native ecosystem. Trait comparisons between native and non-native plants are often laboratory-based, providing insights that can be difficult to apply to natural communities. Studies of the impacts of non-native plants, by contrast, are generally performed in natural communities, but usually do not compare observed impacts of the non-natives with those exerted by dominant natives on each other and the community. Thus, the likely relative disruption of the non-native to the community is unclear. In a four-year observational study conducted at the microhabitat scale in the herbaceous layer of a Midwestern oak forest, we compared the non-native herb Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) with dominant native herbaceous species in terms of correlational patterns related to three broad categories of traits: (1) environmental correlates (light, topography, soil nutrients) with presence and cover, (2) inter-annual regeneration and phenology, and (3) associations with other species (competition and herbivory). We found that Alliaria differed strongly from dominant native herbs in all three categories. Compared with native herbs, Alliaria was more strongly associated with south-facing slopes and high nutrient levels, displayed earlier phenology and enhanced dispersal ability, and was strongly avoided by the generalist native herbivore, Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer). Despite well-described allelopathic effects of Alliaria on mycorrhizae and mycorrhizal plants, we found little evidence to suggest that Alliaria had negative interactions with native plants that were stronger than those of native community members. Overall, our data suggest that naturalization of Alliaria in this site is primarily due to differences from native plants in phenology, dispersal capability, and avoidance of herbivory, and that Alliaria is therefore more likely to be acting as a passenger than as a driver of change in our site.

Phosphate Addition and Plant Species Alters Microbial Community Structure in Acidic Upland Grassland Soil	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article							ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM ANALYSIS; BACTERIAL BIOMASS RATIOS; RIBOSOMAL-RNA; MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; DIVERSITY; RHIZOSPHERE; ECOSYSTEM; NITROGEN	Agricultural improvement (addition of fertilizers, liming) of seminatural acidic grasslands across Ireland and the UK has resulted in significant shifts in floristic composition, soil chemistry, and microbial community structure. Although several factors have been proposed as responsible for driving shifts in microbial communities, the exact causes of such changes are not well defined. Phosphate was added to grassland microcosms to investigate the effect on fungal and bacterial communities. Plant species typical of unimproved grasslands (Agrostis capillaris, Festuca ovina) and agriculturally improved grasslands (Lolium perenne) were grown, and phosphate was added 25 days after seed germination, with harvesting after a further 50 days. Phosphate addition significantly increased root biomass (p < 0.001) and shoot biomass (p < 0.05), soil pH (by 0.1 U), and microbial activity (by 5.33 mg triphenylformazan [TPF] g(-1) soil; p < 0.001). A slight decrease (by 0.257 mg biomass-C g(-1) soil; p < 0.05) in microbial biomass after phosphate addition was found. The presence of plant species significantly decreased soil pH (p < 0.05; by up to 0.2 U) and increased microbial activity (by up to 6.02 mg TPF g(-1) soil) but had no significant effect on microbial biomass. Microbial communities were profiled using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. Multidimensional scaling plots and canonical correspondence analysis revealed that phosphate addition and its interactions with upland grassland plant species resulted in considerable changes in the fungal and bacterial communities of upland soil. The fungal community structure was significantly affected by both phosphate (R = 0.948) and plant species (R = 0.857), and the bacterial community structure was also significantly affected by phosphate (R = 0.758) and plant species (R = 0.753). Differences in microbial community structure following P addition were also revealed by similarity percentage analysis. These data suggest that phosphate application may be an important contributor to microbial community structural change during agricultural management of upland grasslands.

Phenological and Phytochemical Changes Correlate with Differential Interactions of Verticillium dahliae with Broccoli and Cauliflower	PHYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							FUNGICIDAL ACTIVITY; NONHOST RESISTANCE; V-DAHLIAE; CELL-WALL; GLUCOSINOLATE; WILT; ISOTHIOCYANATES; ARABIDOPSIS; MYROSINASE; CULTIVARS	Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis subvar. caulifora) is susceptible to wilt caused by Verticillium dahliae but broccoli (B. oleracea var. italica subvar. cyamosa) is not. Infection of broccoli and cauliflower by a green fluorescent protein-expressing isolate of V dahliae was examined using epifluorescence and confocal laser-scanning microscopy to follow infection and colonization in relation to plant phenology. Plant glucosinolate, phenolic, and lignin contents were also assayed at 0, 4, 14, and 28 days postinoculation. V dahliae consistently infected and colonized the vascular tissues of all cauliflower plants regardless of age at inoculation, with the pathogen ultimately appearing in the developing seed; however, colonization decreased with plant age. In broccoli, V dahliae infected and colonized root and stem xylem tissues of plants inoculated at 1, 2, or 3 weeks postemergence. However, V dahliae colonized only the root xylem and the epidermal and cortical tissues of broccoli plants inoculated at 4, 5, and 6 weeks postemergence. The frequency of reisolation of V dahliae from the stems (4 to 22%) and roots (10 to 40%) of mature broccoli plants was lower than for cauliflower stems (25 to 64%) and roots (31 to 71%). The mean level of aliphatic glucosinolates in broccoli roots was 6.18 times higher than in the shoots and did not vary with age, whereas it was 3.65 times higher in cauliflower shoots than in the roots and there was a proportional increase with age. Indole glucosinolate content was identical in both cauliflower and broccoli, and both indole and aromatic glucosinolates did not vary with plant age in either crop. Qualitative differences in characterized glucosinolates were observed between broccoli and cauliflower but no differences were observed between inoculated and noninoculated plants for either broccoli or cauliflower. However, the phenolic and lignin contents were significantly higher in broccoli following inoculation than in noninoculated broccoli or inoculated cauliflower plants. The increased resistance of broccoli to V dahliae infection was related to the increase in phenolic and lignin contents. Significant differential accumulation of glucosinolates associated with plant phenology may also contribute to the resistant and susceptible reactions of broccoli and cauliflower, respectively, against V dahliae.

Similarly, plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) enhance plant fitness and production. In this study, three different AMF (Funneliformis mosseae, Septoglomus viscosum, and Rhizophagus irregularis) were used in combination with three different strains of Pseudomonas sp. (19Fv1t, 5Vm1K and Pf4) to inoculate plantlets of Fragaria x ananassa var. Eliana F1. The effects of the different fungus/bacterium combinations were assessed on plant growth parameters, fruit production and quality, including health-promoting compounds. Inoculated and uninoculated plants were maintained in a greenhouse for 4 months and irrigated with a nutrient solution at two different phosphate levels. The number of flowers and fruits were recorded weekly. At harvest, fresh and dry weights of roots and shoots, mycorrhizal colonization and concentration of leaf photosynthetic pigments were measured in each plant. The following fruit parameters were recorded: pH, titratable acids, concentration of organic acids, soluble sugars, ascorbic acids, and anthocyanidins; volatile and elemental composition were also evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and PCA/PCA-DA. Mycorrhizal colonization was higher in plants inoculated with R. irregularis, followed by F mosseae and S. viscosum. In general, AMF mostly affected the parameters associated with the vegetative portion of the plant, while PGPB were especially relevant for fruit yield and quality. The plant physiological status was differentially affected by inoculations, resulting in enhanced root and shoot biomass. Inoculation with Pf4 bacterial strain increased flower and fruit production per plant and malic acid content in fruits, while decreased the pH value, regardless of the used fungus. Inoculations affected fruit nutritional quality, increasing sugar and anthocyanin concentrations, and modulated pH, malic acid, volatile compounds and elements. In the present study, we show for the first time that strawberry fruit concentration of some elements and/or volatiles can be affected by the presence of specific beneficial soil microorganisms. In addition, our results indicated that it is possible to select the best plant-microorganism combination for field applications, and improving fruit production and quality, also in terms of health promoting properties.

Because fine root turnover constitutes a large fraction of annual NPP, changes in fine root decomposition are especially important. These responses will likely be affected by soil resource availability and the life history characteristics of the dominant tree species. We evaluated the effects of elevated atmospheric [CO2] and soil resource availability on the production and chemistry, mycorrhizal colonization, and decomposition of fine roots in an early- and late-successional tree species that are economically and ecologically important in north temperate forests. Open-top chambers were used to expose young trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) trees to ambient (36 Pa) and elevated (56 Pa) atmospheric CO2. Soil resource availability was composed of two treatments that bracketed the range found in the Upper Lake States, USA. After 2.5 years of growth, sugar maple had greater fine root standing crop due to relatively greater allocation to fine roots (30% of total root biomass) relative to aspen (7% total root biomass). Relative to the low soil resources treatment, aspen fine root biomass increased 76% with increased soil resource availability, but only under elevated [CO2]. Sugar maple fine root biomass increased 26% with increased soil resource availability (relative to the low soil resources treatment), and showed little response to elevated [CO2]Concentrations of N and soluble phenolics, and C/N ratio in roots were similar for the two species, but aspen had slightly higher lignin and lower condensed tannins contents compared to sugar maple. As predicted by source-sink models of carbon allocation, pooled constituents (C/N ratio, soluble phenolics) increased in response to increased relative carbon availability (elevated [CO2]/low soil resource availability), however, biosynthetically distinct compounds (lignin, starch, condensed tannins) did not always respond as predicted. We found that mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots was not strongly affected by atmospheric [CO2] or soil resource availability, as indicated by root ergosterol contents. Overall, absolute changes in root chemical composition in response to increases in C and soil resource availability were small and had no effect on soil fungal biomass or specific rates of fine root decomposition. We conclude that root contributions to soil carbon cycling will mainly be influenced by fine root production and turnover responses to rising atmospheric [CO2], rather than changes in substrate chemistry.

The molecular characterisation of oilseed rape MON 88302 did not raise safety issues. Agronomic and phenotypic characteristics of oilseed rape MON 88302 tested under field conditions revealed no biologically relevant differences between oilseed rape MON 88302 and its conventional counterpart, except for days-to-first flowering. No differences in the compositional data requiring further safety assessment were identified. There were no concerns regarding the potential toxicity and allergenicity of the newly expressed CP4 EPSPS protein, and no evidence that the genetic modification might significantly change the overall allergenicity of oilseed rape MON 88302. The nutritional value of oilseed rape MON 88302 is not expected to differ from that of non-GM oilseed rape varieties. There are no indications of an increased likelihood of spread and establishment of feral oilseed rape MON 88302 plants or hybridising wild relatives, unless these plants are exposed to glyphosate. It is unlikely that the observed difference in days-to-first flowering would lead to any relevant increase in persistence or invasiveness. Risks associated with an unlikely, but theoretically possible, horizontal transfer of recombinant genes from oilseed rape MON 88302 to bacteria were not identified. The post-market environmental monitoring plan is in line with the intended uses of oilseed rape MON 88302. In conclusion, the EFSA GMO Panel considers that the information available addresses the scientific requirements of the EFSA GMO Panel and the scientific comments raised by the Member States, and that oilseed rape MON 88302, as described in this application, is as safe as its conventional counterpart and non-GM commercial oilseed rape varieties with respect to potential effects on human and animal health and the environment in the context of the scope of this application.

J	935		Sas-Piotrowska, B; Piotrowski, W				Sas-Piotrowska, Bronislawa; Piotrowski, Wojciech			Vitality and Healthiness of Cereal Grains Treated with Plant Decoctions	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA			Polish	Article							SEEDS	In experiment, the activity of decoctions on the vitality and healthiness of five cereal species: Triticum aestivum L., Triticosecale Wittm., Secale cereale L., Avena sativa L. and two forms of Hordeum vulgare L.: brewing barley and common barley, was examined. The materials under investigation were: water extracts (decoction) made from different morphological parts of 40 plant species: 1. Acorus calamus L. - rhizomes; 2. Aesculus hippocastanum L. bark; 3. Aesculus hippocastanum L. - flowers; 4. Allium sativum L. - bulbs; 5. Archangelica officinalis Hoffm. - roots; 6. Arctium lappa L. - roots; 7. Artemisia absinthium L. - herb; 8. Artemisia vulgaris L. - herb; 9. Betula verrucosa Ehrh. - leaves; 10. Calendula officinalis L. - flowers; 11. Camellia sinensis Kuntze - leaves; 12. Carum carvi L. - fruits; 13. Coriandrum sativum L. fruits; 14. Crataegus oxyacantha L. - flowers; 15. Equisetum arvense L. - herb; 16. Frangula alnus Mill. - bark; 17. Hyssopus officinalis L. - herb; 18. Inula helenium L. - roots; 19. Juglans regia L. - leaves; 20. Juniperus communis L. fruit; 21. Lavandula vera L. - flowers; 22. Levisticum officinale Koch. - roots; 23. Linum usitatissimum L. - seeds; 24. Marrubium vulgare L. - herb; 25. Matricaria chamomilla L. - inflorescence; 26. Melissa officinalis L. - leaves; 27. Mentha piperita L. - leaves; 28. Origanum majorana L. - herb; 29. Pinus sylvestris L. - young sprouts; 30. Quercus robur L. - bark; 31. Ribes nigrum L. leaves; 32. Rosa canina L. - fruit; 33. Salix alba and S. purpurea L. - bark; 34. Sambucus nigra L. - flowers; 35. Saponaria officinalis L. - roots; 36. Satureja hortensis L. - herb; 37. Taraxacum officinale Web. - roots; 38. Urtica dioica L. - leaves; 39. Verbascum thapsiforme Schrad. - flowers; 40. Zea mays L. stigmas. The decoctions were prepared as follows (Tyszynska-Kownacka, Starek 1989): 8.75 g of dried material was inundated in 1000 ml of distilled water, remained under covering for 24 hours and boiled for is min. After filtration, the extracts were used for dressing of non-desinfected seeds. The grains were dressed by wetting and shaking for 10 min. in a dressing device. They remained for 20 hours in the ambient temperature. The grains treated with sterile and distilled water constituted the control object. The experiment was performed as a filter paper test (ISTA 2007) with the purpose of the estimation of the following parameters: the germination viability (date I) and the germination capacity (date II). In the above mentioned periods, the evaluation criteria were the number of normally germinated grains; not normally germinated; not germinated and grains contaminated by bacteria and fungi. The paper covers only the data concerning the impact of substances contained in plant extracts on the number of normally germinated and emerged grains and their healthiness (contamination by microflora). The results obtained were subjected to a statistical analysis with the method of an analysis of the variance with a single classification (P=95%), separately for each cultivar, the research date and the evaluation criterion. For the comparison of the results obtained for the evaluated cultivars, the date and criteria of the evaluation, correlation (r) and variability (V%) coefficients were used. The results presented in the figures were calculated in percents in relation to the control object. Carried out experiments have shown that the vitality and healthiness of examined cereal grains treated with the plant decoctions differed significantly in both stages of examination. Regardless of a cereal species, stimulating action on grain germination in the examination date I of bioactive substances from decoctions of a herb of S. hortensis, of seeds of L. usitatissimum and of leaves of J. regia was revealed. In date II there were the decoctions from flowers of S. nigra, from bulbs of A. sativum, from leaves of B. verrucosa, from bark of A. hippocastanum, from herb of A. absinthium. Fungal and bacterial contamination of cereal grains was reduced in stage I by decoctions from leaves of R. nigrum, from flowers of V. thapsiforme, from herb of O. majorana, from bark of S. alba and S. purpurea and in stage II by decoctions from herb of O. majorana from herb of A. absinthum, from fruits of C. carvi and from herb of H. officinalis. Regardless of the derivation of the decoction used for grain dressing in examination date I, the vitality of Avena sativa and Triticosecale grains was strongly stimulated, and in date II there were the grains of Hordeum vulgare - brewing b. and Hordeum vulgare common b. In date I the decoctions most effectively reduced the contamination of the grains of Hordeum vulgare (brewing b.) and Hordeum vulgare (common b.), and in date II - grains of Hordeum vulgare (brewing b.) and of Avena sativa. Triticum aestivum A. absinthium, A. hippocastanum, S. alba and S. putpurea, Triticosecale S. alba and S. purpurea, J. regia, C. officinalis, Secale cereal A. absinthium, O. majorana, A. hippocastanum, Hordeum vulgare (common b.) - S. nigra, B. verrucosa, A. sativum, Hordeum vulgare (brewing b.) O. majorana, M vulgare, C.officinalis, A. hippocastanum, and respectively the grains contamination was strongly reduced as follows: Triticum aestivum A. sativum, S. nigra, A. hippocastanum, Triticosecale S. nigra, J. regia, O. majorana, Secale cereal T. officinale, A. absinthium, O. majorana, Avena saliva C. carvi, A. hippocastanum, V. thapsiforme, Hordeum vulgare (common b.) H. officinalis, O. majorana, A. lappa, Hordeum vulgare (breving b.) T. officinale, I. helenium, O. majorana, H. officinalis. It was observed as well, that the more the examined decoctions reduced a cereal seed contamination, the highest vitality occurred. The correlation coefficients were as follows: Triticum aestivum: r = -0.967**; Triticosecale: r = -0.746**; Secale cereale: r = -0.892**; Hordeum vulgare (common b.): r = -0.324*; Hordeum vulgare (brewing b.): r = -0.169.
